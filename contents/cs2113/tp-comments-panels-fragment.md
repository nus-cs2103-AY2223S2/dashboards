I believe based on java convention, class names should be PascalCase i.e. Ui not UI? See the addressbook-level2 example, [TextUi](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2/blob/master/src/seedu/addressbook/ui/TextUi.java). Unless we intend to name it UserInterface instead?

Perhaps `System.out.print(System.lineSeparator());` would be more platform-agnostic? I'm not sure whether all systems use `\n` as line separators, and Java provides lineSeparator() already anyway

Hmm I wonder if it's more elegant if instead of calling feature.equalsIgnoreCase() multiple times in each if block, and using `if` blocks for matching `Strings` multiple times, you may consider using a switch block like this: `switch (feature.toLowerCase()) {}`. Many IDEs and lints recommend using `switch` for primitives/Strings instead of `if` conditions anyway

Additionally, would `printSeperatorFor()` be a more descriptive method name than `drawLineSeparator`? Since draw is associated with computer graphics, and adding 'for' allows method invocation to read somewhat like English, as in 'printSeparatorFor(feature, ...)'.

Hmm, would a `ui` package instead of `tools` be more appropriate? That is what is used for the [addressbook-level2 example](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2/tree/master/src/seedu/addressbook/ui)

Would addAtomicHabit() be a more appropriate method name? `set` has the connotation that you're replacing/overriding values, which isn't the case here. And this method wraps around the `add()` method of ArrayList, so `add` makes sense. Plus, you're only adding one habit, so `Habits` would be incorrectly plural

I agree with Nicholas. My concept of the command workflow would be having Manager call the `Ui` class to read input(commands), parse command(`CommandParser`), check which `Command` class to delegate to and call `Command.execute()`. So Manager is literally managing the entire feature, although most of its work is delegated to other classes.

What do yall think? @wenxin-c @nichyjt @YongbinWang

Thank you for the notification.

Yes, I propose breaking `help` into 4 parts: the feature keyword(e.g. `hb`), a `String` of the entire list of supported commands, a brief description of the feature, and a detailed description of the feature.

I propose delegating the 4 parts this way: feature keyword is stored in the feature's `Manager`(exposed with a getter), `String` of all subcommands is also stored in the feature's `Manager`(also exposed with a getter), brief description of the feature is also stored in the corresponding `Manager`. The complicated part, and the part that warrants the most discussion is I believe the detailed description. This is my rough concept for it:

-`Manager` will have a detailed _overall_ description of the feature, such as `Atomic habits: Inspired by the book ..., this feature allows you to propose and keep track of atomic habits you desire to develop in the hopes that it may improve your lifestyle.` for the atomic habits feature
-Every `Command` of a feature will provide(via getters, one each):
1. `String` of all the arguments for that specific `Command`
2. Detailed description of the command(what it does, any default behaviour when optional arguments are omitted, etc)
-`Manager` will provide a getter for a detailed description of the entire feature's commands. This is essentially just iterating through all of the `Command`s and calling their argument getter and detailed description getter
-`HelpCommand`'s job is to standardise the format of the brief description and detailed descriptions, and iterate through all the `Manager`s when printing the detailed description(via each `Manager`'s getter), and print the output using `TextUi`
-`HelpCommand` **will not** know about what commands/features are supported by `WellNus` or what description they have, this will be delegated to helper methods provided by `Manager`s for encapsulation and to aid maintainability so that individual feature developers will decide how they want to describe their features and commands

What are your thoughts @YongbinWang @nichyjt ?

I would highly recommend avoiding the usage of Java reflection for something so basic, since the intention here is just to get something that's compile-time constant. Perhaps an attribute exposed by `ReflectionManager` would be more appropriate and achieve a similar goal. Java reflection is best avoided unless you understand what you're doing I feel

Hmm the log severity conflicts with what @nichyjt uses for his logging, I believe a lower severity level is more appropriate? Since our app can just ignore an invalid command and still run as normal without taking any measures, making it a trivial issue.

Wait I don't agree with this for two reasons:
1) Duplicate code for defining `stringOfUpdatedHabit` and printing
2) There should be a warning to the user when the increment is zero, instead of just doing nothing and acting like this is intended behaviour.

I propose moving the `incrementCount > 0` check to `getIncrementCountFrom()` and throwing a `BadCommandException` when the increment is 0(after calling `Integer.parseInt()`

For this can you move the FIRST_CHAR back here but rename it to a `firstChar` variable instead? It's best to minimise the scope of variables, especially since FIRST_CHAR wouldn't make sense outside of the `execute()` function

Might be meaningful to explain _why_ SelfReflection is modelled as a `class` instead of just an `ArrayList&gt;ReflectionQuestion>` directly in `ReflectionManager`, e.g. abstraction so `ReflectionManager` will only need to call `new SelfReflection()` and not be responsible for setting up the reflection questions, which is useful because reflection questions set up logic might be updated in the future

Hmm effectively what you're doing here is tell `QuestionList` to add a new index to its `dataIndex`, so why not provide a `QuestionList.add(int index)` helper method instead? For abstraction and encapsulation so your logic in Commands is simpler

For encapsulation purposes, I would avoid making this public, or having such a method at all. Usually, when you have a Class representing data like `QuestionList`, you expose helper methods that do the modifications to your internal data for you, i.e. something like `public void add(int index)` that adds a new index for you, not let outside classes call `getDataIndex().add(index)`.

Outside classes shouldn't even know what is the data structure inside `QuestionList`. That would be good OOP/encapsulation

I would avoid logic like this for encapsulation purposes. Instead, try adding a new `QuestionList.hasRandomQuestions()` that does this for you.  In fact, this is the only usage of `randomQuestionIndexes` in this class, so you duplicated the reference to `randomQuestionIndexes` and consumed additional memory, which isn't ideal. If you encapsulate this call in `QuestionList`, you don't need an attribute `randomQuestionIndexes` in this class at all.

Wait this is a unit test right? Wouldn't it suffice if you call `HashMap&gt;String, String> arguments = CommandParser.parseInput(LIKE_COMMAND)` and `LikeCommand likeCmd = new LikeCommand(arguments, questionList)`? Best avoid involving other classes when you're just testing `Command` classes

Would this entire method be more suitable in `QuestionList`? i.e. turn it into `QuestionList.getFavQuestions()`. Since you don't even modify the `dataIndex` variable in `FavouriteCommand`, you just need the conversion.

Moving it over would properly encapsulate the internal data structure of `QuestionList`, which is good OOP.

Plus, `QuestionList` is the one dealing with `ReflectionQuestions`. Think `ArrayList`: you can call `ArrayList.toString()` to get a String representation of data, you don't ask `ArrayList` for its internal `array[]` variable and then `for` loop through it to get a String representation

I think this is unnecessary because you already catch it as an exception, which means by the time the code reaches this line the assertion is always true.

Hmm actually in AtomicHabitManager the only time `BadCommandException` is caught is when an unrecognised command is given(e.g. `test`, which is not supported). So I think it would be more appropriate to print something like:

Also, on line 175 I think you should log the `BadCommandException` message, i.e. do `LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, badCommand.getMessage())` instead since the new usage note message is super long and floods the log, example:

Hmm `&&` is intentional, this condition basically means a keyword(e.g. `test`) is none of the known feature's keywords and also not a recognised 'main' command(e.g. `help`), so it's an invalid command(throw `BadCommandException`). Does that make sense?

Aha, this particular edge case is actually caught in `GamificationStorage` line 33. No exception will be thrown if data file doesn't exist. My intention is to _not_ create the gamif data file if no data is saved(i.e. no XP points updated during the app run), since any XP update will trigger a `Storage.saveData()` call that creates the gamif data file if it doesn't already exist.

Basically lazy initialisation of the data file to reduce unnecessary I/O.

Tested this to ensure that no exceptions occur in 4 cases:
1. gamif data file doesn't exist, XP updated: Stats is restored successfully on the next run of the app
2. gamif data file exists, XP updated: stats is updated and restored successfully the next run of the app
3. gamif data file doesn't exist, XP not updated: stats is the default value, no exceptions thrown, stats is still the default value on the next run of the app
4. gamif data file exists, XP not updated: stats is restored successfully

Some suggested shared behavior(and their functionality) for `Managers`(to put in the abstract superclass):
-getFeatureKeyword(): Returns the command keyword, e.g. hb, timer
-getArgumentsForFeatureDescription(): Returns the full list of arguments supported by the feature, e.g. add [--name] &gt;name> for hb
-getBriefDescriptionOfFeature(): Returns a brief description of this feature to be printed by the basic help command
-getFullDescriptionOfFeature(): Returns a full description for the corresponding specialised help command of this feature, e.g. help hb for hb
-isValidCommand(): Accepts a HashMap of commandline arguments and returns a boolean for whether they represent valid input for this Command
-goToFeature(): Brings user to the specific feature's user interface, where feature-specific commands are then available. Expectation is goToFeature() will exit and return to its parent event driver when user elects to exit the feature

Is UI supposed to be extended on by each feature?

By declaring different formats by each feature from the get-go, we are going to introduce tight coupling across many features.

This might cause many merge conflicts and regression issues down the line as our project grows.

Do you think it makes sense if we have a single SEPARATOR variable or method that can be overridden?

I think that we may face scaling & human error issues if we approach labelling features this way. 

 Labelling by character may be confusing to the developer.

Perhaps we can consider using an `Enum`.
Along the lines of:
```java
enum Features {
    MAIN,
    ATOMIC,
    REFLECT
}
```
Why I'm suggesting this is because this is because this syntatic sugar will allow us to know **exactly** what we are dealing with.

When we process features, using enum would loosely look like:
```java
if(feature == Feature.MAIN) { ... }
else if(feature == Feature.ATOMIC) { ... }
else if(feature == Feature.REFLECT) { ... }
```
I feel that this is more easy to read (as developers) and allows us to make less errors rather than
```java
if(feature ==  'm') { ... }
else if(feature == 'a') { ... }
else if(feature == 'r') { ... }
```

In terms of scaling, all we need to do is add an entry on the enum file. 

What do you think?

In practice, I think it may be unlikely that we need very fine-tuned lengths for the separation.

Do we expect TextUi to be extended upon?

The previous PR had different separators, so I'm wondering if this is the intent as well.

If we want to be able to extend, there should be:

2. Documentation at the start of TextUi hinting what can and should be changed on extension

What is the difference between this and printOutputMessage other than the input type?

I think there is an opportunity here to print a unique separator to indicate an error since there is a function for exception handling!

A key reason why we decided to have the `TextUi` class is to abstract away `System.out.*` method calls. 

I think that if a method exists to abstract away a certain function (such as printing a message), we should use that method rather than reinvent the wheel. 

Because of that, I think that the call to `System.out` here is in violation of SLAP and makes the code less cohesive.

This seems arbitrary at a glance - perhaps it would help if you added in a comment explaining what is going on here.

Alternatively, 
You seem to be replacing the last cycle `break` with a `longBreak`.
Instead of the math, why not use ArrayList's built in methods?
```java
int lastIndex = session.size() -1;
session.remove(lastIndex);
session.add(longBreak);
```
I believe this would be much more readable and any reader will know immediately what you are trying to achieve. For your consideration, please.

It seems like there is some on-demand base-60 conversion going on to calculate minutes and seconds. This feels very *verilog-y* 

I think that moving forward, this might be harder to debug, especially when debugging edge cases such as sending commands when `seconds == DEFAULT_STOP_TIME`.

You can ignore this comment for now, but here is my two cents regarding maintainability and readability for time:

Can I ask what is the benefit of maintaining the extra logic and constants to handle this base-60 logic?

Could simply storing the number of `seconds` be sufficient?

To get the minutes and seconds, one just needs to call a function that does:
```java
int minutes = seconds/60;
int secondsLeft = seconds%60;
```
This may be much more readable & maintainable than calculating the minutes and time per-tick. We get rid of constants which may help us developers reduce some cognitive load.

Performance wise, we also avoid potential pitfalls if the timer task's `run()` is run concurrently to an input command (something like a [race condition](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/race-condition)).  

Reducing the if-else block (thereby improving performance of the time-sensitive `run()` block may reduce the execution time of that block and reduce the probability of race conditions happening. (This is a very minor issue though, as I believe java would properly handle concurrency in their Timer task).

Edit: Code correctness

Can you give an example?   

Your phrasing "missing argument" is vague as it could mean that the delimiter is present but the name of the argument is not.
Or are you asking if there is no argument at all?  e.g. `mainCommand payload`

If it helps, I  accounted for various edge cases in the [unit test](src/test/java/seedu/duke/command/CommandParserTest.java) that encompass "missing argument"  with inputs such as: 
- `mainCommand payload --`
- `mainCommand payload -- `
- `mainCommand payload -- payload1`
&hat; All of the above will throw an error as the argument is 'missing'.

Oh! This is actually defined behaviour.  

In this case, payload1 is accepted as an argument (key value).  

CommandParser's job is to screen for syntactically wrong inputs only. Setting payload as argument is a logical error on the users' part.   

As we discussed, the responsibility of logic-based checks like type-checking and length-checking is up to each feature using CommandParser to avoid tightly coupling the Parser to each feature.

This also follows the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://nus-cs2113-ay2223s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/common/definitions.html#s).   

A benefit of the hashmap architecture is that we can effectively ignore bad inputs like these.  
We can just `.get` the keys we expect to have.

If we want to be super strict, on the feature level, once an unknown key is encountered, the feature can just throw a custom `InvalidArgument` exception or handle the error along those lines. 

I don't see a way to differentiate arguments from payloads without each feature's parsing logic being tightly coupled with each feature's unique requirements. What are your thoughts?

The idea is that the control flow logic will be done in the `run()` event driver  

I anticipate that the control flow logic will include IO for all Manager instances and subclasses. Parsing of the input would naturally require the CommandParser, so I included this getter

If a custom `CommandParser` needs to be used, this function can be overriden

Good point. The help behaviour is being implemented by @haoyangw so I'll keep him in the loop for this.

Do we want to enforce a Manager-level help function that prints every command in the argumentList?
Or are we offloading this to a `HelpCommand`?

Implementation in manager would look something like (pseudocode): 

```java
public void printHelpMessage() {
    System.out.println("Usage for " + getFeatureName());
    for(Command cmd : commands) {
        Ui.print(cmd.toString());

The reason this setter is left in is to force all developers to properly populate the argument/command list. 

The idea is that this prevents developers from defining their own constants with their own names -- this will lead to integration issues with the methods that require a call to the arg/feature list, such as `isSupportedFeature`.

Yes, this will set the current countdown index to the last index.

I'll explain the thought process here for documentation sake and for you to check if it makes sense!

This behaviour due to your initial implementation of the code where increments will only occur on `start` and `next`.

To have this logic work without excessive use of flags and passing messages between components, I thought that the common behaviour for `start`ing a session the 1st time and nth time would naturally be to have the pointer at the last countdown with the `isReadyFlag`. 

The idea is that when a session ends, the `currentCountdownIndex` pointer will always point to the last countdown object. Since increments are only done in `start` and `next` commands as per your implementation, I need a way to differentiate between the two using the `isReady` flag. 

To make this behaviour invariant,the  `stop` command also forces `currentCountdownIndex` to point to the last countdown object and toggle its `isReady` flag to true.

```java
// starting from StopCommand line 81
session.getCurrentCountdown().setStop();
sessioninitialiseSession();
session.resetCurrentCountdownIndex();
```

I have experimented with making the timer 1-indexed and even having the flag on , but without massive workarounds to have flags being passed between `Countdown` and `Session`, it is unfeasible. I felt that it would be much better to work with the code you have implemented already since it works! 👍🏼

On further thought, @haoyangw do you think it makes sense if:

`isValidCommand()`  throws an exception rather than return a boolean?  (if yes, then I'll rename this to `validateCommand` to follow coding conventions

This way we can pass a custom exception message so that we know exactly what went wrong with the command. This should help with debugging efforts too when we start implementing it.

A good side effect is that it also forces us developers to be aware of the exception and handle it via `catch` properly

@haoyangw what are your views on this?

When I discussed with wx offline she shared her difficulties in understanding how to implement validate command on the Manager level. Of course, I can think of a way to make this possible but...

Should validation be done on Manager or Command level?

I thought about it and I now think it may be better to do it on command level.  
If we implement on Manager the method might be quite long as we are aggregating all the command validation logic in one place. This won't scale very well. 

Command level validation will nicely decouple the components

Thanks @haoyangw for the detailed writeup and post-mortem analysis of the crash. This is an excellent learning point for the whole team. 
 
Haoyang, I agree with the proposed changes for SelfReflection. The benefits make sense and I've actually mentioned these in my PR reviews before. For reference:
- https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T12-4/tp/pull/35#discussion_r1133057443 &gt;- buggy behaviour
- https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T12-4/tp/pull/27#discussion_r1131179789 &gt;- extensibility

To prevent this from happening again, as rule of thumb:
`static final` and `static` should be reserved **only** for constants. Refer to https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T12-4/tp/pull/31#discussion_r1131876665

By constants, I mean magic literals that have only one state (its literal value).

From now on, I propose that this should be much more strictly checked during PRs.

To add on to the discussion, I think the whole intent behind the agreed upon architecture through the `Command` and `Manager` boilerplate is to **instantiate** all variables that have **state** within the constructor. This is enforced through the `abstract` methods. This should have made integration much less difficult and more standardized. 

Let's be more careful with the way we use the `static` keyword from here onwards.

What do the others think?

Some thoughts regarding your `static` implementation:
1. If the random numbers are going to be coupled with quite a few commands - why not refactor this out to another class than tie it in with the Command constructor?

Format of start1 start2 is q confusing lol can use startToAdd and startExisting to prevent confusion.

I think like what one of the PED comments said, maybe it would be better for us to format it so that start time and end time comes before the class itself? otherwise you can just use the default toString for timetable i think it prints in this format liao no need to so mafan get this get that HAHAHAH

Syntax looks wrong. Should use this.accounts.add(myAccount) instead. Or if you want to use addAccount, you can do this.addAccount(userName,balance). Should work with no issues and I think you will be able to remove the `static` from the accounts atttibute in both classes.

[Try not to use static variables if you can avoid it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7026507/why-are-static-variables-considered-evil).

With the above suggestion in mind, it might be preferable to extract out sections as functions, keeping in mind SLAP.

To solve this, go to line 325 of accountList.java, which should be in the foundAccountToDelete function. Then add the line `doesNameExist.remove(name)` below it. Then, cut out this part of the code

    createNewAccount();

 in the same function and paste it below this section of code in the deleteAccount() function in the same file

```randomQuestionIndexes``` will also be used to map user input index to real question index and I think it is better to keep this logic at ```LikeCommand``` as it is something beyond the list of questions only.

also because of this, I need to call ```questionList.getRandomQuestionIndexes()```. I was thinking to move ```questionList.setRandomQuestionIndexes()``` into ```questionList.getRandomQuestionIndexes()``` due to the previous comment.  It will lead to bug and I need to separate get and set for ```randonQuestionIndexes``` so as for ```GetCommand```, the setter need to be called separately from getter.

Yes I agree with the rationale behind avoiding using static. 

What I did to fix ```SelfReflection``` is to change all the methods and attributes(except constants) to non-static, so that every time when an object is created, a new array of 5 questions will be created. Since we have to create an object, this solved the issue of accessing empty array as mentioned by haoyang. This also makes sure every time an ```SelfReflection``` object is created, the number of questions will be as intended as the size will always start from 0. This also addressed the bug of program crash after inputing two ```get```command.

Todo: 
Regarding the ```isExit``` attribute in ReflectionManager, I left it as ```static``` as I havent figured out what's the appropriate way to implement this as I will need to change this attribute in other objects. Do yall have any suggestion to solve this? I'll look at how yongbin implements this part as well.

I think the concept of replacing magic strings with constants is to improve code readability. If things like `.` and ` ` are replaced by constants i think it is over excessive. For `[` and `]`, I think putting it inside a method is sufficient.

we shouldnt have filtertype, we can filter multiple things at once, as mentioned above.

also we do not need an additional filtered PCList, we can just check which PC's meet the filter requirement and print them. Also printing the filtered PCList like this will result in wrong indexing for the user to edit items.

Maybe it would be better to return `Optional&gt;Tag>` instead of a potentially nullable `Tag`? That way we don't have to manually check if a Tag is`null` in the rest of the code.

Yep, or restructuring our if-else into an `Option::ifPresentOrElse`. IMO this makes it clearer that the return value can be `null` because it's not obvious from the current method signature that it may not find a `Tag`. 

Especially if we call this from elsewhere, we might forget to check for nullity, so `Optional` will also help us recognize that

I think this is more confusing than having the Options being built in each XYZKeywordParser -- since our command looks like `&gt;keyword> &gt;action> flags`, once we parse the action we shouldn't need to look at the keyword anymore (so a more hierachial design).

If you wanted to go by the OOP route, perhaps something like this would be neater:
- Since `OptionsBuilder` does not really have a state (i.e., `model` and `action` are only used once, then a new `OptionsBuilder` is created the next time), maybe you could just do `static buildOptions(String keyword, String action)`
- Have an abstract `KeywordOptionBuilder`, which `XYZKeywordOptionBuilder` extends
- Move all the option building (e.g., `buildDeleteOptions`) to `XYZKeywordOptionBuilder`. `XYZKeywordOptionBuilder` will have a switch-case on how to handle each **action**
- `KeywordOptionBuilder.buildOptions` has a switch-case to handle each **keyword** and call the appropriate `XYZKeywordOptionBuilder.buildOption()`
- Functions that are used by multiple `XYZKeywordOptionBuilder` can be protected static functions in the abstract `KeywordOptionBuilder` (e.g., `buildCardSelectOption`)

This design is parallel to how `KeywordParser` and `XYZKeywordParser` are currently designed.

Another way we could do this is to put the save file somewhere else, i.e.,

- Adding/deleting cards updates a "hidden" save file in AppData (or some application storage location)

I think at the very least we could use build a `HashSet` of all the CardUUID. I think having bidirectional mapping might be a performance-centered story on it's own

> To address the tester's question, we can probably clarify in the UG about the usage of "-q" and "-a" as potential questions and answers. We can suggest to the user that if they want to put in math questions, then they can use "Q: " and "A: " or something instead.

I think what they mean is that the user may want to use tokens that resemble the flags themselves in the question/answer, e.g.

Q: How do I specify a question
A: Using the -q flag

We could try using some escape character, but this is such a niche use case that maybe we should just point out that this isn't supported in UG

> Showing the tag name and deck name in card is not trivial. This is because we cannot simply edit the `toString` of Card as it will not have access to `tagList` or `deckList`. An option is to not do this in the `toString` of card but that will mean every time we need to display a Card (`card view` , `card tag` `card list` ), we need to manually call the functions to display the `tags` and `decks` instead of simply printing Card. Will that be preferable? If yes then I'll go and implement it.

That's a good point, but I think it's worthwhile to implement. We could either do:
- Store deck/tag name alongside deck/tag UUID in`Card`
- Let `UserInterface` handle mapping deck/tag UUIDs to deck/tag names

I think the latter is preferable and one way I can think of implementing it is to add a hashmap from deck/tag UUID -&gt; deck/tag name in `TagList`/`DeckList`. Should be fairly straightforward since we have add and delete methods, and we can make our search functions O(1)

The main issue comes from `Ui.java`, where you have opened up another `Scanner` in the `printWelcomeMessage`. When the program exits the function, it causes the `Scanner` to be closed. Apparently in Java a closed standard stream cannot be reopened, at least from what I found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33555283/why-is-not-possible-to-reopen-a-closed-standard-stream).

One possible workaround would be to remove the portion on asking for the user name and just provide a generic welcome message for all users.

this is non trivial and need to discuss as right now, the task list is a mixture of todo, event, deadlines and they are not grouped together according to type. in our user stories, there is a seperate story for filtering by type so we might want to think about this

okay this one is not trivial there are some edge cases we need to consider.
Case 1: user adds an event into a tasklist and then adds a module with their scheduled lesson.
The lesson will obviously take precedence over the event, which is one-off, do we remove the event or do we throw an alert telling them that there is a clash. 

Case 2: what if the user does not remove the event, how are we gonna display it? :/ 

case 3: what if it clashes, and stretches over a few days (like a holiday) then are we gonna not let the user add it? or for 2.0 we just let them add events into the tt despite having clashes and the most the app does is to alert them that there is a clash

Ideally we should have the add command be flexible with it (aka add with or without category would both work, in the same way edit command works if you only edit one variable), but it's not a big deal.

Not a bug; missing functionality/issue. Fix is to add individual words to the itemNameHash and trie for a product instead of the whole product name, but adds complexity, hence low priority issue.

Nvm I found the issue. 
On line 23, writeCSV is called, but since we added InventoryData.csv to gitignore, the program has to write the file. 
While the program is still writing the file line 24 and 25 runs in parallel.
Time of check of inventory &gt; time of use where writeCSV is done.
kinda TOCTOU bug ig >&gt;
the question is why it's only popping up now

edit: can confirm, deleting InventoryData.csv and then running the test once fails it, running it again passes it.

I think the issue is because while hardening readCSV I used the checkFileValid command to validate the file with regex at the start, so the command has slightly less time to write, hence triggering the race condition.
Will try adding a small delay?

Do you want to assign a string to the enum instead? An example would be:
```java
public enum Currency {
    MYR("MYR");

If the commands are just capital letter and the dashes are replaced with underscore, do considering implementing it in such a manner:

```java
public enum CommandType {
    EXIT, SHOW_RATE;
}
```
## String to Enum
```java
String command = args[0].replaceAll("-", "_").toUpperCase();
CommandType type = CommandType.valueOf(command);
```
By default, the second line should already throw an error if no such enum value is found. Example can be found in the other file with the ShowRate class. You can create an utility class with generics for future enums.

## Enum To String
```java
String command = CommandType.EXIT.name().replace("_", "-").toLowerCase();
```
## Alternative
Alternatively, just use an interface.

I think it is ok to keep this, because we still need to divide by 100 eventually. The fix should be in the constructor where we multiply by 100 instead as we intend to multiply by 100 to store in integer and account for the cents. I have did this in my branch

I have doubts about this implementation because this makes it seemed that we are trying to put in magic literals to make the unit tests and pass, telling the future developers that the output is already incorrect. Try see if you can make the tests pass without adding a `/100`. As mentioned previously, one fix would be to keep the `/ 100.0f ` and multiply the balance by 100 in the constructor when assigning it. I have attempted this fix in another branch.

Hmm the purpose of multiplying it in the constructor is for abstraction. As the users, we just need to know that we pass in say SGD 100. Behind the scenes, it will be stored as `balance = 10000` and `currency = SGD`. When we perform a `getBalance`, it will divide the balance by 100 behind the scenes again and get back the SGD 100 which will also be the expected input and output.

The issue is that in the `Account` class, the currency is stored as an enum and the balance is stored as a long. In the `getBalance` getter, the data is converted into a float. An alternate solution would be to add in 2 extra getters to get the currency as string and the balance as long.

I believe we should be perform exception handling at the [main class](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-W15-2/tp/blob/a4e205596740b9bc65ab5253443871ccbad7ed6a/src/main/java/seedu/duke/Duke.java#L26).

Please use the constants in [`EntryConstants.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/constants/EntryConstants.java). Doing so will help reduce code clutter and better accommodate to future changes if required.

Instead of making these variables public, I suggest using a `final class` to store your constants to reduce code clutter. The commands can also be stored in `seedu.duke.constants` so that they can be reused in testing without needing magic strings.

I think you raised a valid point. Since the commands are integral components of the application, the use of literals in test cases is justified. However, we should also take note of the differences in meaning when using literals and constants in test cases, where constants help pin down the behaviour of the method as raised in this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3360840).

This issue is highly opinionated and will not be considered as a bug for the application.

As highlighted in the [`SimpleDateFormat` API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html), 
> For parsing with the abbreviated year pattern ("y" or "yy"), SimpleDateFormat must interpret the abbreviated year relative to some century. It does this by adjusting dates to be within 80 years before and 20 years after the time the SimpleDateFormat instance is created.

the following command would result in an error since it is ambiguous:
`/view -sd 01/01/43 -ed 31/12/19`

As such, it would be good to highlight this behaviour to the user in the user guide.

The most recent update for the user guide may be confusing to users who are not familiar with reading documentation. As such, it would be clearer to highlight the exact behaviour of the `/view` implementation using examples.
For example, `/view -ed 13/12/99 -sd 13/12/23` does not result in an error, even though the user may want to filter entries from 13th December 1999 to 13th December 2023. However, the  start and end date filters are mixed up, which the application interprets as filtering from 13th December 2023 to 13th December 2099 and does not give an error message.

Thank you for bringing up the point on non-numeric values! After some consideration, I have decided not to use the Validator here for 2 reasons. 
1. I need to implement custom logic for both potential errors, either setting the balance to 10 million if it is too large or 0 if it is negative. The validator throws the same exception with different error messages, and working around it would probably lead to some janky logic. 
2. The gson parser already handles the potential non-numeric cases by throwing a parse error. We currently handle that by wiping the file as it is deemed an "irrecoverable" error. We also avoid precision errors as we store the balances as integers instead of floats, so it cannot be edited to have more than 3 decimal places.

This command is only called after input is already formatted. Why format the input again and have to catch the format input exception? The try-catch within try-catch should be avoided.

While this code works to find out an account that does not exist, exceptions should only be used to designate a negative path for the intention of the method. The getAccount method is not being used for its intended purpose, instead its exception is used as the success path in a sense.
I suggest instead of using exceptions and this method to find the missing account, you could create a boolean method in the AccountList that determines the existence of an account.

It was advised to run this method before command execution, however after some consideration, we will run this method twice. Once after the expenditures have been read off the saved file and the second continuously in the main loop of the program. For the latter we will have the method ran before saving the list in the main program so that the repeated date can be saved immediately after user input

I think a name like `printlnSeveralStrings` would be a better name. `print` can be mistook as printing something on the same line, and I think the `text-ui-test` bug above is due to this exact mistake.

Hi, just want to clarify: I made my lower bound in ShowRate and Exchange 0.01, because inputting any smaller value then becomes 0. I think this case is caught when you check for more than two decimals, because an input less than 0.01 would be at least 3. Please just take a quick look if you don't mind. Otherwise, great job implementing the validator.

All of these checks exist within the Validator class. Might it be possible to run the parsed account value through the validator class? You also do not account for checking for non-numeric value, which could be an issue. Either way, great implementation as is, use the validator if you feel it is necessary. Great job!

This variable cannot be removed. The constructor for ExchangeRates calls fetchExchangeRates, which makes the API calls. Creating this object is equivalent to calling ExchangeRates.fetchExchangeRates(), but I want to keep access to fetchExchangeRates() private.

I called initializeRates() for the first test only, because the static array of rates in Forex will then be initialized for the other tests. After we merge this PR I am going to improve testing for show-rates by extracting the parsing to a new method, so I can work on it then.

Also on this note, the API is also being tested through these tests, which I think is important to do. Using mocks may not reveal errors with the API, such as when our monthly calls expire. Replacing the API key is very easy, so I am in favor of using the API for testing, but happy to change it.

Thank you for your feedback! I have attempted to include comments for each if-else block to better explain what each path does, and have extracted the switch case to reduce the code length in that function. I have opted to use comments and blank lines to split the different categories as breaking the switch-case into smaller ones will result in quite a bit of repetitive code, as the same case for each expenditure has to be written out twice.

This could be a possible suggestion, like we could try just including the name and the tag for creating new recipes. 
Then if people want to add ingredients and steps to the recipe, can use the ingredients and then steps tag separately to add on to the recipe that is created.

So an example input could be like this :

user  : "add /n Corndog /t Korean"

ToM  : 

1. [Koean] Corndog

user  : "addingredient 1 i/ Corn, Flour, Eggs"

ToM  : 

Here are 3 ingredients added to the recipe:
1. Corn

Good idea to inform the user when all ingredients are gone! As there are some overlapping logic in both cases, you can consider grouping them together and separate only the message printing. An possible alternative is to set quantity first, remove if new quantity is zero else do nothing, then print the corresponding message :)

Good abstraction of this method. I was thinking if there is any way to improve the design as the update to indexOfExistingIngredient is a side effect of this method even though it is a crucial part of this class. An alternative could be to change this method to return the index directly. An invalid index like -1 can indicate not found in list. This will also remove the need for indexOfExistingIngredient member!

there are a lot of things you want to hide, for example, credit card number, or crypto wallet seed phrase. It is hard to be consistent and hide all. So for the sake of this project, since it shouldnt even be done on CLI as CLI inputs can be tracked, we will keep password in plain text. The same problem exists for if you want to view, i.e. password will be revealed in plaintext @kairuler

- Recommended: Users can use the save command OR continue using the app as per normal. All previous data will be erased when new data is loaded in.
- Try to recover the state of database.txt. You may have accidentally edited some characters in the database.txt file causing the corruption. In these cases, undoing these edits will cause the application to import the previous data on next load.

Instead of repeating code here, you can nest the `hasQuantity`  if-block inside this block and make use of short-circuiting.

For example:
```
name = foodInfo[0];
date = foodInfo[1];

if(hasQuantity) {
    quantity = foodInfo[2];
    String[] foodDetails = {name, date, quantity};
    return foodDetails;
}

String[] foodDetails = {name, date};
return foodDetails;

I have a dumb idea. Maybe can split by '-' instead and check the first character to see which detail it is so no need to write this else block.
For example:
`add -n bread -e 11/12/23 -q 8`
After splitting by '-', we get:
`n bread`, `e 11/12/23`, `q 8`
Based on the first character we know which detail it is.

Hi, I feel that the validator method is not very suitable for use in this case as it throws an exception which is not useful in this case. I feel that a boolean method which return `true/false` will be much better so I can set the category to the default category `unclassified_food`  when `false` as I cannot prompt the text file to give me another value.

Yes, but the methods are slightly different. For example, the Boolean methods I wrote for `unit` and `category` only return `false` rather than throwing an exception when invalid. This is so as I can set the default value for these 2 attributes instead of deleting the whole line of data. I feel that a single corrupted attribute should not warrant the whole food object to be ignored; especially as `unit` and `category` are not very significant attributes (users can probably deduce the values of these 2 attributes based on `quantity` and `foodName` respectively).

Maybe consider splitting by "-" rather than with "-e" - after having more flags later (quantity, categories, etc.), it will be much easier to scale this method. 

You can then just operate on "e [details]", "q [details]" chunks through splitting flag name from the details

Hey @wanjuin, why do you find it weird? The unit can be set without without quantity and I think it makes sense. I also think it makes sense that it shows nothing until the quantity is more than zero. If you add a unit then quantity you will see that everything is fine, too.
Here is the screenshot

1. I add the `if (scan.hasNextLine())` to pass Github's checks. I don't know why but the checks inform that there's an error at this line. By the way, it seems that Line 18 will not skip one line of input when I run the program.
2. I think putting it in UI is OK, because it follows the definition of ui(user interface), and it's not doing the parser's work. I followed the nus-cs2113-AY2223S2/personbook and put this function into UI.
I will try to remove the if-clause first.

I feel that maybe the class diagram might be too complicated. Since the website mentions that we should try to make the diagram comprehensible but not necessarily comprehensive. I think most of the methods are quite trivial(getters and setters) and might not be needed in the class diagram to keep it simple. Main highlight should probably be the attributes to highlight what is represented by the class.
For my command class diagram I also omitted some methods/attributes which I felt was less relevant. We could discuss this further if needed to standardise!

For line 30-39 of command class, the checks is to ensure that the name of the shortcut does not overlap with an actual command like `view`. So a command such as `shortcut view -maps add -out noodles $5` will be prevented. This is because previously the actual `view` command will take priority over the configured shortcut `view` command, and to prevent any confusion we can stop the user from creating such a shortcut.

I think we should not restrict users to creating shortcuts for just add and filter, as there could be other legitimate uses like `shortcut v -maps view` etc. The suggestion of only allowing valid commands to be mapped can be a future feature consideration, but for now, the short-term fix is that the terminal will print the shortcut that the user is currently using and the actual command executed so that the user can be aware if their shortcut command is invalid, as they are using it.

I would presume this Line is what causes the program to crash

because when the program runs for the first time, and there is no main account and the size of the [private ArrayList&gt;Account> accounts] is 0 the getMainAccount will throw an index out of bounds exception when u try to access index 1 of an arrayList of size 0. I think once u solve this should be fine

you can add this isMoreThanTwodecimal() method to AccountList class as well so that u can directly do:
```
if (isMoreThanTwoDecimal(balance)){

}
```
            
 in that way you will not need to access the .getMainAccount method and can resolve the issue mentioned below of an index out of bounds exceptions.

No need to remove the following code as we cannot allow users to delete all remaining accounts without having one account intact:
```
if (accounts.size() < 1) {
//would be good instead if you could help to add a ui message here  to tell users that 
//they need to create a new account because there isn't any active account left.
//once done can close issue #120 when u merge this PR
       createNewAccount();

if the args here is not a valid integer, then `Integer.parseInt(args)` will already throw a NumberFormatException. So I think it might be good to consider how to refactor this without the try and catch in the else.

```
        if (size == 0) {
            throw new NoTransactionsFoundException();
        }
        try {
            int index = Integer.parseInt(args) - 1;
            if (index > size || index < 1) {
                throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
            }
            transactions.remove(index);
            size--;
            ui.showTransactionDeletedMessage();
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            throw new NumberFormatException();
        } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();

I think something like the above might be a better way to refactor.

The changes were mentioned in the commit history, perhaps have a look at that? Primarily changed the code as per IntelliJ's intellisense recommendation since there were only two switch cases and had nothing to do with personal preference of liking or not liking a code. As you've mentioned both result in the same outcome; hence, as per the BFS approach its better suited to code what suits current requirement and change as program grows. Nonetheless, as this segment grows its always possible to change it back to a switch case at a click of the button. 

P.S: Will mention such changes explicitly in the PR next time.

Mentioned in UG that extraneous parameters will be ignored, Though the add-account wasn't mentioned in the "such as" portion--meant to be non-exhaustive, it was mentioned in the add-account subsection that it doesn't take any parameters.

will need to resole this as per issue #63. However, the problem is not related to the creation of a new account with an empty name. Instead, the current delete method is problematic because it uses the .contains() function, which can result in the current account being mistakenly identified as the account to be deleted if it has an empty name (i.e., matches the .contains(" ") condition). As a consequence, the program deletes the current account, leading to the message "account: deleted" being displayed as the ui.showAccount deleted used the argument to the delete command as a param which was " ". I think I have resolved this bug in the latest PR #109 .

In response to the bug report, I would like to point out that this issue was clearly stated in the User Guide. Additionally, we provided instructions for the user to address the problem by deleting the save files and restarting the system. It is important to note, however, that this action of corrupting the save files will lead to irreversible loss of data.

I personally feel this is something trivial. Allowing users to deposit or withdraw $0 does not have any impact on the program's functionality or the balance. Therefore, even if a user mistakenly enters 0 instead of 10, they can always enter 10 again, as the 0 would not affect the balance. This process would be similar to what a user would need to do if an exception was handled.

I think the updating part is okay. As for the Food Class `toString` part, I set it as if `quantity == 0`, it will not show quantity and unit; else it will print quantity and units. However, users can only check the feedback message and they may feel that the unit is not updated as there is no sign showing that it is updated.

Perhaps you can add another message to tell the user that “As you are not adding any quantity, we will not show the quantity and updated unit”  or a feedback message like “You have successfully updated `unit` to `kg`!” to avoid misunderstanding!

According to sources online, string constants are used so that we do not need to type out the same thing multiple times. In this case, since the string constants for e.g. `LEFT_SQUARE_BRACKET` is more of a hassle to type than `[`, i think that your suggestion is valid.

Perhaps we could consider an `enum` to store these predefined expense categories such that testing is made easier? 

With that, we can create a method to loop through each category within its `enum` and then pass it into `assertEquals()` for testing. This also makes future testing more convenient if more categories were to be added.

@jinxuan-owyong  Noted on comment above. Will store the strings above as constants in  `seedu.duke.constants` as suggested.

For this highlighted segment however, I think the better practice would be to ensure test codes do not reference production code, as the guarantee that the refactored code is still 100% working may be lost.

The intention of the change was to replace the error message with a placeholder first until the other features were successfully merged. `UIConstants.NEWLINE` seemed to be causing formatting issues that failed the `.\runtest.bat` tests.

I don't think so. Last time I asked our TA and he said it's fine to store all objects in one `LoanRecords`. So I think updating `LoanRecords` is enough, and when `Person` needs to check history, it just makes the query `loanRecords.findByPerson()` and it will return a list of past loan history.

Hello tzixi, this is expected behaviour. If you modified the endTime data in the json file but do not edit the hasEndTime field, the storage component will treat the file as corrupt and discard all data presently in the save file. 

As mentioned in the user guide:
> 🚧 Warning: If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, NUSPlanner will discard all data and load an empty data file at the next run.

Hope this helps.

i agree with the over-excessiveness, but it looked rather inconsistent in the method when `LEFT_SQUARE_BRACKET` was used alongside a `". "`, so i decided to use string constants all the way. thoughts? (additionally, DOT_SPACE was used thrice in the Ui class)

@nicholas132000 our TA recommended using string constants in the code review for my part #221

Actually i decided to return the return to `fullUserInput` instead of `fullCommand: String` since the reader would not know what fullCommand refers to (CLIAlgo has this variable which is not included in the sequence diagram) and by convention the return arrow `-->` is the return variable of the method being called. What are your thoughts on this change? Thanks!

> * [ ]  Given that the withdrawal and add currency command are remarkably similar, do you want to consider giving the class a generic name like UpdateCurrency? This helps to reduce the error if changes is made in one class and not reflected in the other one? Then you can have a boolean flag to determine whether it is `isAddCommand`. This reduces duplicated code as well.

Not sure about this, I feel that this is correct. `THB` here is the `WithdrawAmount` which is not a float. `10000.00` in this case would be the description.

Oh I am already throwing an exception in `cardList.findCardFromUUID(cardUUID)`. The assertion is just another layer of protection to make sure that it will never ever be null, which is the whole point of assertion because we are already sure that at that point it will 100% not be null @ltzehan

I think auto-exporting before the program exits seems better considering how whenever user adds new cards, it will most likely be a bunch at once so there is no point to only export at a certain point. From the perspective of the user, having to manually export provides little to no benefit but it brings quite a bit of inconvenience.

Issue has been diagnosed and the reason is because current version of savedata.json does not have any `tags` and `decks` field. After they are manually added, tagging now works on both newly added and old card. 

Solution : 
-  the save() function will need to add the `tags` and `decks` field to the `Card` so the next instance it is run,  the card can be tagged and decked.

Showing the tag name and deck name in card is not trivial. This is because we cannot simply edit the `toString` of Card as it will not have access to `tagList` or `deckList`. An option is to not do this in the `toString` of card but that will mean every time we need to display a Card (`card view` , `card tag` `card list` ), we need to manually call the functions to display the `tags` and `decks` instead of simply printing Card. Will that be preferable? If yes then I'll go and implement it.

I just manually searched for the relevant tags in decks in `card view`, since `card list` does not need to show the tags and decks. Anyway, the UI has been enhanced in #159. I think this is not bad for now.

small issue but does this count as not following SLAP? from what i understand the purpose of `printLine()` is to be used in other classes so we don't have situations like:
```java
Ui.printSomething();
System.out.println(LINE); //different level of abstraction than the line above
```

for the methods within the Ui class, i'm not sure if it's necessary to replace everything with `printLine()`.

To "edit" command user guide, this is not a bug but a feature. User misunderstood curly brackets in user guide as valid format when it is actually used to represent a selection of possible edits (Can choose between name ,qty, price edits). Program interpretted price input of p/12} , which contains an invalid input of "}", causing the not updated error message to be outputted as shown.

Resolved this issue as shown below. Attributes revert to old value even if small portion of command is invalid. Bug shown above no longer causes a crash.

Below shows that attributes remains unchanged even if subsequent inputs or inputs before invalid input is valid. In the example shown below, qty input is invalid, but name and price is valid. Correct error message returned and list is not updated.

No longer causes this issue. List will not be updated if the input is wrong. Correct error message also printed now. Reason why this happens initially is because program detected "p/0}" which contains the "}" string, causing the error.

As you can see, `Cat` with upc code of `1111` is not updated.
Noticed that the initial command also caused name to change from `Cat` to `{capybara`, which is due to code using .contains() instead of using .startsWith() method. Code is also changed to resolve this issue.

Number Format Exception refer to below website to understand
https://www.javatpoint.com/numberformatexception-in-java
in essence the `Integer.parseInt(quantityAndIndex[0])` in `createPackObj()` can only convert string to integer from a limited range, suggestion is to limit the maximum quantity of an item to be 100 

- need to check for similar error in integer unpack and packall (limit to tracking 100 items in a packing list)

This was an optimization update as the original way of joining the UID string was using the `+` operator to concatenate. However, I used the `StringBuilder` class to optimize the concatenation to speed up the UID generation. I also added guard clauses for the UID generation to protect the first part of the 3 part string. Initially the first part of the string has no limit and anything can be concatenated to the other parts. However, now only valid strings can be concatenated.

The status command only shows core modules, thus modules in the planner that are not core modules will not be shown. As for MCs, they are for the total MCs taken. 22 MCs were from the core modules and I'm assuming the other 4 MCs are from an elective module.

@ltzehan I don't think the "-q" and "-a" thing is an issue, and it seems like the displaying of "null" is the only issue.

To address the tester's question, we can probably clarify in the UG about the usage of "-q" and "-a" as potential questions and answers. We can suggest to the user that if they want to put in math questions, then they can use "Q: " and "A: " or something instead.

ui.getIndexToDelete(maxCount) only allows for entry of integers from 1 to maxCount. Users entering a negative int is not possible. Hence, since method can only return ints (no null), negative int is used to break the loop of getting a valid int for index to be deleted.

The intent of our application is to complement and ease the process of accessing healthcare at a lower severity level. Just like all other personal health records in other government applications like healthhub or the SAF eHealth system, users are not allowed to delete their medical history since healthcare providers are bounded by the law to retain such information. Our group will update the user guide more specifically to address this issue. Thank you for your feedback!

Thank you for your feedback! Though our product appears to be multi-user, it actually only works with one user using it at a time. The login and registration process is just an enhancement feature for us to secure our patients medical information. In the screenshot above, our application does not allow running on a shared computer with many users using it at a time since you can only "login" to one account a time. Secondly, the data file cannot be accessed by other users during regular operations.

We will clarify with the teaching team just to be sure as well.

This is an invalid command due to z not being recognised as a symptom choice. But i agree that it can cause confusion since our program still works. We will update the print statement accordingly for v2.1. Thank you for your feedback!

> @Brennanzuz I think you have a "severity" measure right? is it possible to let user control that variable? if not we could just close it because it's not in our scope

The severity measure was a constant value assigned to each value intended to be used for filtering patients that require medical attention from doctors, but has not been put to use yet.

You make a valid point. There are only so few unique characters that a keyboard can input, and only 26+26+10=62 are intuitive for users to input. However, the scope of our project is small enough to not exceed 62 possible symptoms to report and thus this method of inputting is feasible albeit unsustainable in the future.

The intention behind it would be to inform the user what exactly is he entering into Dr Duke. This example here accounts for the case where the user enters the same "s" consecutively. But for cases where the "s" might not be entered consecutively, for example "absefsgts", 3 s's are entered but not one after the other, so showing 3 error messages would let the user know he "accidentally" entered the same symptom 3 times.

Entering more than 24 symptoms is not actually entering more than 24 symptoms, but rather entering "duplicate" symptoms, thus giving the impression of a user inputting more than 24 symptoms.

Dear Sir/Mdm @nus-se-bot , thank you so much for your valuable feedback! To further clarify, the notes feature actually fits well with the product aimed to save users' time when performing Mathematical Operations. An example of this is for users to store say for example the equation of ```sin((π/2) – x) = cos x``` into BadMaths such that users can easily retrieve this equation while already using BadMaths instead of referring to notes/searching it up on google.

This is not allowed in tP, where the program can take another input based on previous command.
If it is allowed, then we would have made our application selecting the menus only 1,2,3 which is faster.

`filterByCategory` is still functional and standalone from the `cat [Category]` function, while they both output items from a certain category, `filterByCategory` will display each item's name, upc, quantity, price, while `cat [Category]` is more to serve as a quick lookup table with only items' name and upc code.

Because of the `.toLowerCase()` function in most of the updating/modifying category codes, even if the input was initialized to 'Uncategorized' it will end up printing as 'uncategorized' instead in list function after a few adding/editing/removing move has been done. Also, some of the tests with had 'Uncategorized' did not manage to pass. Might be more ideal to standardize to all lowercases.

<img width="985" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-02 at 8 00 26 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88696064/229323413-42e362c2-e0b0-420c-b8ad-ba13d0e4c3cd.png">

However, if I changed it to here, the code can catch and flag the exception:

Is there any downside to catching exceptions in constructors?

> Edit implemented: immature because if you input sd only, st would be overwritten by "".

Hi actually I guess this is what we do deliberately, we allow user to only input sd and st is optional. And in this case parser will pass in "" to that param and Event.java will recognize this and only show the startdate later if other funcs ask for time details (e.g. toSrting)

Thanks for the feedback! Do note the following: In account registration, users are typically not allowed to use existing usernames. In our case, we allow users to use any usernames they want, including existing usernames, but of course that also means rejecting use of existing passwords. Unfortunately, its a tradeoff that needs to be made.

I have updated the addorder function for **SINGLE** menu items, to be able to take in complete or incomplete names of menu items.

Examples of legal commands:
`addorder -i rice -q 1`
`addorder -i "chicken rice" -q 69`
`addorder -i "c" -q 29`


I will be working on extending this functionality to the addorder function for multiple menu items next.

This tester used java 19 instead of java 11.

When our application is run with java 19.0.1, the user will receive the error message as shown by the tester.

Here is a screenshot:

@Thiolk i do not think it will be a bug, but I agree that there should not be a case where a user gets to grade the modules using the `grade` command when there is already an `edit` function for it. Will update the code and submit a PR to fix this soon! Thanks for pointing this out! 💯

Nope, no intention to accept these grades. A W grade for a module should just be deleted by the user instead, since it is equivalent to dropping and "not taking the module". Furthermore a W grade does not count towards calculation of the CAP as well.
