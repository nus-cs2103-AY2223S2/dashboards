I can see that you have made a very thorough effort for your iP! Keep up your good work! I just want to highlight to you that you should uses verbs like "Starts" or "Runs" for javadoc, and not "start" or "run", as per the Java Coding Standard. 

Also do remember to not use wildcards "*". "Rationale: Importing classes explicitly gives an excellent documentation value for the class at hand and makes the class easier to comprehend and maintain. Appropriate tools should be used in order to always keep the import list minimal and up to date. IDE's can be configured to do this easily."

I'm very impressed with your coding standards! Well done! The most that I have observed is just whitespaces that need to be added here and there! Other than that, no major violations! Keep up the good work! I'm sure that you will be a good programmer in the tP if you keep this coding standard up! :) Jiayous for the rest of CS2103!

I liked how you took the time to separate out all the commands, and abstracted command as an interface. 👍

Overall code quality seems good, although it seems that generally head comments are missing for the classes (as required by the coding standards).
I like how the README is update even though its not part of the requirement. However, it confused me as the seemingly unnecessary files were committed to git/github. For example, data files (i.e. `duke.txt`) and mysterious log files (i.e. `q`).

Overall, it looks like the task are only done up to week 2, so there are still missing features and are missing coding standard stuff (such as packaging and javadocs). Do try to catch up!

Good effort 😊 Here is a some general overview:

* Good effort to separate the different tasks into separate components
* Can try to choose method/variable names that are self-explanatory
* Avoid unnecessary line breaks/indentations

Moving forward, you can also try to extract the different components into their own class, i.e. `Parser`, `Command`, `Ui`

All the best! 🔥

Well done on the GUI, it looks amazing! The different packages and class show good OOP paradigms and effort on your iP. 

There are only minor JavaDoc and style issues. Mainly `white spaces` and `unused variables`. The missing JavaDocs for the methods can all be one-liners so they are not egregious at all. 
I have highlighted some of these trivial errors but seeing as how they repeat, I have attached the [Full Checkstyle report here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2223S2/ip/files/10607890/main.2.docx) instead of commenting one by one.

There's no need to create a new List instance, I personally feel that these 3 lines of code can be rewritten as:
```
List<Task> taskList = tasks.getTasks();
        Task currTask = taskList.get(taskNumber - 1);

        currTask.setDone(true);
```
```
tasks.get(taskNumber).setDone(true)
```
By implementing a  `get` method in `TaskList`, you can get a reference of the `Task` and call task methods to mark/unmark them.

It seems that a lot of logic is crammed into this method.

In the event that this method bugs out due to one of the methods, it can be difficult to find the error point and the offending switch case. 

I would suggest encapsulating the logic for each switch block in its own `Command` class, and all of them may have a `simulate` method that handles their own errors and outputs a UI regardless. This also makes it easy to define test cases for each of the commands and isolate the logic there.
Also, this would in the future make it easier to change the logic for each command, as you would only need to modify the target Command class' `simulate` method.

These can be output by a Task -&gt; DeleteTask class that is responsible for outputting the relevant UI message to the UI. The UI then need only have a single method that parses string messages and outputs them in the desired format, or even be changed to output UI elements in the GUI.

In general, good approaches are used in the project, but they may be further improved by:
- code splitting: Breaking the logic up into atomic chunks that handle their own errors and are easy to modify and fix.
- more test cases: Currently, events such as invalid dates being passed to Events or wrong usage of creating Events/Deadlines are not tested, and if future changes break the code, the logic will fail silently.

Overall, the coding standard/style seems okay. There's just a few glaring issues:

- Incessant use of `if-else` blocks makes it hard to debug
- String addition lumped together on one line makes it hard to understand the returned String's structure
- Unclear variable names
- Repeated code throughout multiple blocks decreasing readability (solvable with OOP)

Please improve on the above so that I and others can understand your code better 😊 Thank you!

The string (has a minor typo, "OPPS" should be "OOPS") printed makes it look like an error, but `true` is returned which makes it seem like this is not an error. Perhaps it could be made clearer by either not printing "OOPS" in the message to show that this behaviour is intended.

I like how you gave your bot a personality! 
Your input validation is also very well thought-out, I will have to learn from how you considered the many different invalid inputs. 👍

Overall, this shows good efforts! Most classes and methods are well documented, but there are still some Javadoc missing. Besides, it might be better if we use more descriptive names for variables in some places, and pay attention to the naming of methods (use verbs for class methods, as suggested [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/codeQuality.html)). Some "magic numbers" can also be replaced with constants to improve readability. :smiley:

i use vscode also but i don't use the prettier formatter. instead, i use the [java language support by redhat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java) extension instead. 

you can clone [my formatter settings](https://github.com/filbertphang/ip/blob/master/.vscode/java-formatter.xml) if you want the target switch case behaviour. the relevant setting ID is `"org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter.indent_switchstatements_compare_to_cases"`

I find the use of multiple `continue` instructions in the code strange. The while loop already has a looping behaviour once it reaches the end of the loop, so using `continue` to return to the start of the loop should not be a default behaviour. What is your rationale for designing it this way?

Rather, I would suggest the following structure:
```java
boolean isRunning = true;
while (isRunning) {
    if (textInput.equalsIgnoreCase("bye")) {
        isRunning = false;
    } else if (stmt) {
        code;
    } else {
        code;
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you may consider parsing the command first, then using a switch-case statement to handle various cases.

Overall, I like how you did your Peppa application. It's nice and easy to follow through the code and some of the things were pretty unique like the displayed messages etc. It's pretty amazing how you even created an interface (or sth) for it (aka Launcher.java, Main.java etc) and followed the OOP principles and Coding standards.

There are a couple suggestions below which you could look through and see. Not much of an issue overall and these suggestions is optional.

Here i believe this method should be named to clearly reflect what it's doing. Also, this part can be replaced with the following and it will look much neater.

this.isDone = false;
return b;

I feel there are some unnecessary repetitions in this method. I like to structure it like this: 
`String str = line.substring(8);` and `Task newTask;`  declared before the if statement. A value to newTask (like `newTask = new Todo(todo, this.checkMark(line.substring(5,6)));` in the if else statement. Then at the end `addTask(task);` after the if statement closes.

Perhaps there is no need for the `return null;` statement? Since your last else block will throw an exception, the code will not reach this last return statement. Its also best to avoid returning null sometimes to avoid NullPointerExceptions

The method name could perhaps be changed as it is misleading. numOfTasks would normally imply returning the number of tasks the list contain. However, you are just getting the string of whether it task should be plural or not. Method names should also start with a verb instead.

I feel like there is no need to use `super.getStatusIcon` and `super.getDescription` since your Deadline already extends from Tasks. Hence, these methods already exist within the Deadline class. Furthermore, the use of this should be removed if there is no multiple instances of it. This is a suggestion.
```suggestion
    public String toString() {
        return String.format("[D] [%s] %s (by: %s)", getStatusIcon(), getDescription(), doBy);

A lot of nested blocks. Consider abstracting away with methods within the main class. For example you can have:

switch(...) {
    case "todo":

}

// add implementation
public void addToDo(String[] tokens) {

I notice you tend to have many of such hardcoded whitespaces in your printed output (including in other files). Perhaps it would be better to have a `final` String variable storing these whitespaces, or a `final int` storing the width of such whitespaces, for easy modification in case future changes are needed.

Uncaught `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown when no `/by` is supplied by the user, causing the program to crash - could catch it and print an error message to the user, and then continue to run normally.

Generally, for error handling, there are 2 types: adding a `throws` clause to a method, or using a try-catch block. The first one should only be used if you are throwing it upwards to be handled by the consumer method,  or caused by input parameters, or you don't want to handle them and just let the program stop. In all other cases, the try-catch block is preferred as you can meaningfully handle the exceptions and let users understand the error.

Generally, even for user inputs that start with 1-index. You should use 0-index for your internal data structures and convert the user inputs index. Otherwise you'll have to do a lot of necessary steps down the road with your methods such as deleting, checking for max length, and your constructor having to add a dummy task which takes up resources.

Overall, the code is mostly easy to follow, but there are a few places with overly nested logic. Additionally, there are a few minor deviations from common coding standards. It is great to see that the code is well-commented on, making it easier to understand. Some of your methods are getting lengthy, making them difficult to read and maintain. Consider breaking them down into smaller, simpler methods.

Overall code looks good 👍, only a few minor mistakes relating to coding standards. 

Additionally, apart from your code, remember that for each git commit to include a commit message subject (a requirement from the [git conventions](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html)). 

Keep up the good work and all the best for the future weeks!!!

Could this be extracted out so other `Task`s that require datetime parsing can use it? For e.g., this method could go in the base `Task` class.

Also, [`LocalDateTime.parse(CharSequence text, DateTimeFormatter formatter)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDateTime.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter-) might make the parsing easier and more readable.

I believe int mark here refers to whether the command is marking a task as done (`mark == 1`) or unmarking/marking as not done (`mark == 0`). In this case, since `mark` can only take two possible values, I think it is better if `mark` is a boolean variable. You could also add javadocs here explaining what `mark` means to avoid confusion.

Overall, I like how you have adhered to the Java coding standards and quality guidelines most of the time. You could also consider creating Command classes (e.g. AddCommand, DeleteCommand etc) that encapsulates the action of executing the relevant user command, to make your code more OOP.

minor nit about spacing which was mentioned in the coding standard.  this can be also be found in other similar methods.

Hi, I think this variable name can be more descriptive, when I first saw it I thought it was short for describeCommands but it seems like it is short for descriptionCommands.

Was thinking you can put your commands as an enum, with a tag to check if it has any descriptions.
Something like:
```java
public enum Command {
    TODO("todo", true),
    LIST("list", false);

    private final String command;
    private final boolean desc;

    Command(String command, boolean desc) {
        this.command = command;
        this.desc = desc;
    }

    public String getCommand() {
        return command;
    }

    public int getDesc() {
        return desc;
```

I noticed some of your methods implementation in this file do not quite align with its semantic meaning, one might expect a boolean value to be returned by reading the javadocs. 
The name for the method as a noun may have circumvented this but it feels weird (using exceptions as a control flow) to have a method whose sole purpose is to throw errors. Perhaps an alternative approach would be to simply throw an error in the main execution if the user input evaluates to false for all your 'checkers'?

For tasks, maybe consider using Factory methods inside a parser. You can then encapsulate the parsing logic inside the parser. With that said, this may result in 
```java
case "D":
case "T":
case "E":
   parser.add(response);
   break;
```
Just a suggestion to keep code concise, but currently still looks good 👍👍. For your consideration.

Regarding variable declarations in `case` blocks, it might be better to wrap them inside their own scope. This prevents potential name clashes with other branches of the `switch` statement.

Since you override the `executeCommand()` method in all child classes of `Command`, perhaps you can utilise polymorphism and call the method outside the `switch case` block?

Though not explicitly mentioned in the coding standard, perhaps this class should be named `ToDo` instead of `ToDos` (i.e. without the s)? All of the examples for class name given in the standard are singular nouns, and this change would also make the naming of this class consistent with the others in this project (e.g. `Deadline`, `Event`).

Perhaps the format of the JavaDoc header comment here can be further improved? The coding standard states that the first sentence should be written as a **short summary of the method**, as Javadoc automatically places it in the method summary table (and index). However, the first line of this header comment appears to be truncated and not complete. 

Additionally, perhaps consider adding an empty line between the description and parameter section, as per the coding standard? This applies to all other JavaDoc comments without the empty line.

Would naming classes representing different types of tasks and event as "AddSomething" lower the class dealing scopes?

I think your code looks good!! Maybe need to abstract out a few more exceptions to be more specific instead of just passing in the error message to the DukeException constructor. Also, your variables tend to not really inform the user what they are (especially in the case of your shortened variables). Typically, when working in a group, it is necessary to make it easy to understand at a glance what the variable is doing.

I would make the argument that `else` statements after `return` statements are redundant. Perhaps you can consider removing the `else`s for better readability, leaving only the `if`s! (I actually lost style marks in cs1010 for putting an `else` block after an `if... return`)

According to the code quality standards, you need to [avoid long methods](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/codeQuality.html#avoid-long-methods). I suggest splitting the handling of commands into a separate function or class.

The checking of length for a specific command in the input involves 'magic' numbers which the code quality document advised against. I suggest that you could check the command by splitting by the first whitespace encountered or split the input by the whitespace characters. For example:

```java
// input: "todo my description"
// inputTokens: ["todo", "my", "description"]
// command: "todo"
String[] inputTokens = input.split(" ");
String command = inputTokens[0];

if (command.equals("todo") {
    // ...
}
// ...
```

Might want to consider changing `updated_deadline` to `updatedDeadline` to adhere to the Java coding standard of naming variables in camelCase. I noticed that you used snake_case instead of camelCase in several other areas of your code as well.

Overall, I think most of your code following the Java coding standard! 

But you may want to take note of the few instances where you used snake_case instead of camelCase for naming variables. These issues should be detected by using checkStyle.

In general, I think most of the coding standard requirements are adhered to since most methods and variables are adequately named.

Overall, the coding standard has been followed, just apart from some minor issues! 👍 In most of your classes, do remember to keep fields private to prevent unwanted modifications by the user. It might also be good to declare Task as an abstract class since it should not be instantiated at any point in the program. Do let me know if you have any queries regarding my comments :)

Have you considered capitalizing the commands? Such that a command like "Help" would be able to parse. I recommend using String.toUpperCase()/toLowerCase() method to capitalize/lowercase the words when parsing the input.

Perhaps this might break when you delete the data directory? 

Deleting the data directory (that came with the zip file) results in your code being unable to recover from this deletion. Hence, the tasks are no longer stored across sessions. You might be able to observe this if the .jar file is run in 2 separate sessions. 

Just pointing this out as this seems to be a marking criteria. I recommend using Files.createDirectories() and the relative path methods like System.getProperty() and Paths.get() as a way to get around this issue.

Hi there!
Overall there was good use of OOP principles and naming conventions in your code. You might want to consider refactoring the code in your run() method to be stored in a parser class instead. Additionally, you might also want to consider packaging your classes more such as moving your event, task, deadline and todo under a single 'Task' package.

Should this `t` be renamed to `task` instead to make it clearer? Though, not a code violation.

There's a lot of repeated `System.out.println` calls in the code, all of which adds a divider on the top and bottom, and indents the text. 

To [minimize code duplication][dry], perhaps you can abstract out them out to a `say` or `printString` method to print a multi-line string along with the divider and indentation? Like:

```java
public static void say(String whatToSay) {
    int indentLevel = 6
    String indentation = " ".repeat(indentLevel);
    String indentedInput = whatToSay.replaceAll("(?<=&hat;|\n)", indentation);
    
    System.out.println(divider);
    System.out.println(indentedInput);
    System.out.println(divider);
}
```

And then call the method like:

```java
public static void markTask(ArrayList<Task> array, String[] splitInput) {
    array.get((Integer.parseInt(splitInput[1])-1)).markAsDone();
    say("Nice! I've marked this task as done:\n"
            + array.get((Integer.parseInt(splitInput[1])-1)).toString());
}
```

Maybe you can put all your code under a `duke` package.

Looks like you're missing an empty line between the description and parameters, I've noticed this in other constructors as well.

Based on the coding standards, `case` clauses shouldn't be indented (yeah, it's kinda weird).

So, it should look something like:

```java
switch (x) {
case 1:
    // ...
    break;
case 2:
    // ...
    break;
// ...
}

Unrelated to coding standards, but you can check out `LocalDateTime.parse`

You can pass it the specific format you want and it'll also throw a `DateTimeParseException` if the string is in the wrong format, so you can save the trouble of validating it yourself.

[Here's the docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDateTime.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter-) if you want to read about it.

Your method names seem consistent, but maybe you can have `markTask` and `unmarkTask` instead to differentiate the `show` actions that do not affect your data?

These two lines look like they're being repeated in the other cases.
Since `Deadline` and `Event` are subclasses of `Task`, maybe you can use polymorphism to factor this out?
</panel>

<panel  header="**9 :fas-comment:**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2223S2/ip/pull/159#discussion_r1090389335" expanded>

It might more sense to name `todo` as `description` or `taskDesc`, since that's the field name in `Task` (maybe also for the `taskName`s in `addDeadline` and `addEvent`)

---

Also, a pretty cool trick with `split` is that you can pass a `limit` as the second parameter, so you can do this to extract just the first word:

```java
String input = "todo trash the trash";
String[] arr = input.split(" ", 2); // only split to 2 elements
arr[0]; // "todo"
arr[1]; // "trash the trash"
```

So you can do something like this if you want to:

```suggestion
        String description = input.split(" ", 2)[1];
```

It's a bit longer, but at least you won't have to hardcode the number of characters.

(I would actually recommend doing the splitting after line 35 so that you can separate the command and arguments immediately)

You can use `String.format` here if you want (and anywhere else with a lot of concatenation)

Also, since you're using `taskArr.get(i)` a lot, maybe you can store it in a variable.
```suggestion
            Task task = taskArr.get(i);
            System.out.println(String.format(
                    "%d. [%s] [%s] %s",
                    i + 1, task.getIcon(), task.getStatusIcon(), task.toString()));

Maybe this can be changed into a better noun? I kind of thought that with the existence of verb methods like toString, toMark would also be considered as a verb, but I can also see that toMark can serve as a noun, so maybe keeping it as it is is good.

for your conditionals and everything that requires a () bracket, if there is curly braces after it, it would be best to leave a white space before the curly brace. eg.

Although this code is just a WIP, I would just like to leave a comment: perhaps changing out the private LocalDate "by" with dateBy, or a more descriptive name would be better!

Although this code is just a WIP, I would just like to leave a comment: perhaps changing out the private ArrayList "list" with tasks (note plural), or a more descriptive name would be better!

I was impressed by your DateTimeParser (did not know of these methods I could use). Your use of appendOptionals to give the user more options to input the date has also inspired me to do better! However, Maybe you could have added a short comment here to explain the parser member as there does seem to be some implicit logic involved?

Very minor nit here but according to the [coding standard for Javadocs](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#comments), each parameter description should be punctuated. Perhaps you could add in a period at the end and capitalize the first letter after the parameter (`dateTimeString A date and time string with the format "dd-mm-yyyy hh:ss".`)

Perhaps could include javadocs for these 2 methods in Command class and omit in child classes. Then, you could use @inheritDoc if the method in child has slightly different behavior from parent method.

I think you may need to include JavaDocs soon 😄, but in general I feel your code is easy to read and I couldn't spot many coding violations, so I believe that implementing JavaDocs wouldn't be an issue for you. I think the only other small issue I spotted was the indentation of the switch statement, and maybe a few import statements, which someone else has already commented on. I can see that you avoided arrowhead style code, so that is good to see as well. Keep up the good work!

I think for the description try not to include syntax like the code syntax. I believe this part of the JavaDocs is just supposed to tell us in general what the function does, not what it returns.

Is there a more efficient way to do this? Feels Like a rather long and complicated method, just to segment the "/to" and "/from" strings.

It's great practice that you credited the code owner! But I think the instruction mentioned that you have to enclose the reused code block with the `//@@author` tags, meaning **both** the start and the end of the code block have to be marked!

//@@author {yourGithubUsername}-reused

I cannot comment on the method `Storage.updateStorage()` because it was not modified in this commit. However, I think the Javadoc of this method does not abide by coding convention. 

I think `This method will update the textfile based on the current commands inputed by the user.` should be changed to ` Updates the textfile based on the current commands inputed by the user` to align with convention.

Example of a Javadoc comment:

```Java
/**
 * Returns lateral location of the specified position.
 * If the position is unset, NaN is returned.
 *
 * @param x X coordinate of position.
 * @param y Y coordinate of position.
 * @param zone Zone of position.
 * @return Lateral location.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException  If zone is <= 0.
 */
public double computeLocation(double x, double y, int zone)
        throws IllegalArgumentException {

Neat clean code with good use of OOP overall. My suggestions are to check the Javadoc comment for public methods to make sure it refers to the method in third person (in accordance with Java Coding Convention).  Also more test cases would be beneficial for future debugging.

I think this line can be hard to understand, especially as the reader may not know that all Event instructions start with the word 'event' (and similarly for the other Task subclasses). Also, might there be issues if the instruction is just "event", and there is no 6th index? Perhaps using instruction.split(" ", 2) might be better to separate out the words.

Does this handle exceptions thrown if the user passes in something like "delete something"? I think if "something" is passed into `Integer.parseInt` an error will be thrown.

Most of the code standard is closely adhered to, but a few things need to take note: 
1. no Javadoc is provided, 
2. classify the classes into different packages instead of all under the duke package

To avoid having to repeat your error messages, you can possibly throw say an `InvalidInputException` with your intended error message, and then handle it in the Duke class. The section on [A-MoreOOP](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html#a-moreoop) provides an example for my explanation.

It appears that you have many try-catch blocks here. You may consider just using a single try-catch block and then throw the necessary exceptions (eg. `InvalidInputException`, `EmptyInputException`)  that will subsequently be handled in `Duke` as mentioned in my previous comment.

Your code looks really neat and readable.

Overall codebase is very neat! Keep it up! I would suggest that each method inside Duke.java can be extracted out as commands so that Duke can only be responsible for mainly running the "run" command

If you're keen to explore you could try writing DukeException to automatically print specific messages based on the task and error in DukeException.java. Currently, DukeException behaviour is no different than a normal Exception class since you could also pass the same messages to an Exception object and throw it.

Overall the current idea of throwing DukeExceptions is good too!

It might be better to move the error handling to within the individual method commands

I suggest you to just delete all these unnecessary commented code. That is mainly the point of a version control system like git which is to undo any changes that you might not like in the future. Commenting them out and leaving them in code makes your code unnecssarily long and confusing.

Coding standard is decent.
* Compliant with information hiding and encapsulation. No public class variables.
* Boolean variables start with "is".
* Indentation is strictly 4 whitespaces.
* Line length is never no longer than 120 chars.
* Strictly follows Egyptian style brackets and correct letter case for most names.
* Appropriate whitespaces within statements.
* All variables are initialized at declaration.

Some rooms for improvement:
* Minor naming errors.
* Should put every class in a package.
* _Documentation plz_ 🥺

Overall, LGTM. However, the input text file for testing is missing probably due to incomplete tasks but the rest of the issue is to fix a few nits such as listing the commands in enum class as it can help to reduce the amount of code written. Improvements can be done on the design such as handling the ui by creating methods in a UI class, instead of directly printing inside the action method (i.e handMark() ). But then, this is just a heads up before you start on A-MoreOOP task. Great job completing up to Level-6!! 😃

Single letter argument name (t) might make sense here because the method is short, but maybe we can guard against future confusion by just using "taskList" as the argument name instead since in the future this method might get longer.

I think it is also possible to directly print the message within the method itself, instead of retrieving the string and printing it.

Also, I think if you want to get the farewell message for the user, I believe the naming convention should be "getFarewellUser()" which will be more comprehensible.

If I'm not mistaken, it seems like you have implemented Arli in such a way where the user has to enter save before any of the changes made will be saved. For me, I just included this save method at the end of every method in TaskList that made a change to the TaskList, which was why I didn't have a SaveCommand class and if my Duke was to terminate by accident for some reason halfway through, the data inputted would still be saved. But I guess your way gives the user more control over what he can save and should the user decide that he or she isn't satisfied with what's been inputted, a simple restart of Arli will allow them to start over. Depends on what you want to emphasise on for Arli.

I like that you have abstracted the various exceptions for different cases into their own classes, very neat, but you might want to consider whether a centralized class for Exceptions pertaining to Duke whereby the other classes inherit from would bring it up a notch.

I think for this "mark" block, you can do a try/catch block to catch IndexOutOfBoundException in case the user input is just "mark" instead of "mark 1". Applicable to other blocks that require a subsequent input after the keywords like unmark, delete, etc. as well :D

Similar to another comment on the same block of if-else code, with such a long block the readability is slightly compromised (and it is slightly harder to debug), so you may consider editing the code to cater to that (switch cases etc.).

I think since we are using the GUI and FXML for the handling of inputs, there is no longer a need for the use of Scanners since the front end of the GUI will call the handleUserInput() method in MainWindow.java. Perhaps this could be removed?

Seems like `execute(...)` and `runCommand(...)` have very similar purposes. 

Imo you can just omit `execute(...)` since this is used in the `run()` method in Duke.java with Scanners etc but there isn't a need for that anymore with the GUI

Good job! In general there is quite a substantial amount of OOP and abstraction such as having different classes for each type of Command. 

There are some parts of the codebase that could be ommitted though from what I am seeing, such as the use of Scanners to handle inputs. Other than that, everything else looks fine to me!

Not sure if my logic is wrong but would it be better to check if input starts with deadline instead of contain? If somehow the input is "deadline make a todo app /by 2023/02/01" does it cause the code to excercute the previous if statement block of todo?

I like that I could find basically no coding violations in the code. It might be nice to abstract out a Ui class that handles interaction with the user, such as printing of messages and taking in inputs from the user. (It seems to be a requirement for the ip too if I'm not mistaken.)

Perhaps it might be better to extract out the file path for your Storage class methods? Your Storage class constructor receives a String _filePath_ as argument and creates a _file_ field but it is immediately modified in your methods. It is also more convenient if you decide to change your file path in the future.

Great work here! Here's some changes that you might want to consider implementing
- You might want to change names for `static final` variables to be in screaming snake case, and put them at the top of the declaration of class attributes - this helps to distinguish the constant variables 
- There's a wildcard import in `Duke.java`; minor violation
- A few cases of missing whitespace in your exception classes, before the first opening curly brace

Looks good otherwise though! Your code is really clear, and I learned quite a few things :)

Good work here, some suggestions for your code:
- Wildcard imports shouldn't be used, this might've resulted from the default settings in Intellij that auto converts imports into wildcard imports (try disabling it)
- You might want to implement an `symbol` attribute to each type of task, rather than hardcoding it into the `toString()` method. This would also help for the storage requirement, if you want to use the task symbols in the storage format :)
- A `reply(String reply)` method in your Duke class can solve the tediousness of having to print the divider line for each output by the chatbot
- Each case for a switch statement should be on the same indent line as the `switch():` statement itself, there's also a setting in Intellij that disables that

Nice job though, I found your code easy to read and understand :)
