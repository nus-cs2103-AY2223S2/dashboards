LGTM. Just in the future if you're adding onto this, perhaps use polymorphism for the constructor? I see that most of the constructor invocations have this field as false; maybe have another constructor with just CommandResult(feedback, showHelp, exit) with showUserProfile by default false? Three booleans in a row is fine, but if it is going to continue expanding, it becomes quite hard to maintain many commands at once.

Just something to consider if want to add more stuff to it. But if it's going to remain as this method signature, then it's fine.

I don't know how I feel about putting a User Icon. The only realistic way users can change the icon would be to manually put it in the folder themselves. There's no way we want to implement an "upload photo" feature.

Because if you notice, it is very pain to have to set booleans for everything. I've implemented `CommandResult` as a parent class, with children like `ExitCommandResult`, `HelpCommandResult`, and now I guess will have `ShowNewPersonCommandResult` which override the boolean methods. Cleaner this way. Will discuss with the rest tmr, but just a heads up.

I think for these multi-layered stream uses, it would be better to leave a space in between, so that it is more readable. Stream types get crazy sometimes. Also, might want to extract out some methods (though I'm not sure how).

Ok I’ve made it such that the two recommenders don’t rely on each other. TimingRecommender returns a list of time periods so we don’t really need it anymore. LocationRecommender is initialised with the persons, so there’s where we get the timetables.

Ok this is strange. This is saying a Day is composed of Time Periods. Which is not right since a day **schedule** is the one that contains the Time Periods. The _has_ relation should be correct. It’s just that the time table should have an association with TimePeriod directly.

The Location Recommender will be initialised with a set of persons, so that’s where we will get the timetables.  From there, we can test each timing recommended by the timingrecommender.

You can flip the sentence around: 

Directly to the left of each contact's name, you may see the index that EduMate has assigned to the contact.

Or Professor GPT's version:

When viewing your contacts in EduMate, you will notice an index assigned to each contact. This index is located directly to the left of the contact's display name, and serves as a unique identifier for each contact in your list.

## Small grammar mistake

Not all modules that are tagged to the contact **ARE** shown on the Person List. Only the modules that you are tagged with will appear if the contact is also tagged with the same module as you.

The first sentence "your own information or the information of your contacts", because "your own" doesn't quite flow.

Only `HourBlock`s contain `Commitment`s. As such, this is the only way to have a location with a time.

Particularly, `TimingRecommender` returns a list of longest timings as a list of `TimePeriod`s. We cannot attach locations to this. Hence this fragment method is born.

## We need to discuss the fate of `moduleTag` and `Lesson`.

My original thought for `Lesson` would be that it would be identifiable using the lesson code (`T12`, `L2` etc.). In that way, the `ModuleTagSet` could be a `ModuleTagMap` where it would resemble a `HashMap`. So, something like:

```Java
HashMap<String, Set<Lesson>>
```

With an example like:

```Java
{
    "CS2103T": {"L1", "T02"},
    "CS2109": {"L2", "T23"}
}
```

I get the issue with not knowing the lesson code, so we should stray away from this, but the current implementation, which is to define `Lesson` with the module code, day, time, and location, is a little strange. Mainly because the module is irrelevant in this. I originally didn't want it to be this way because we would make the user input these freestyle inputs for time and day, which will lead to alot of bugs. But if we're going down this path, we could repurpose this into a `busy` command. So, for example, `busy 2 Monday 0900 1000 Bedok` would make the person busy during that time. Conversely, `free` would do the opposite `free 2 Monday 0900 1000`.

Or, safer for us, we could use `9am` type of notation so that we are safe on the partial-hour things.

Ok back to the Sort Command. For ascending/descending, the arguments that work are `z/`, `z/a`, `z/d`, `z/A`, `z/D`, `z/aahjklfdsh`, `z/dkrejlhjsfd` (basically anything starting with a, d, D, A). The rest will give the default ordering. So probably can add that to the Sort Command UG.

To change the code need to change quite a few things, so it has to be a UG thing.

Yes, I agree with @seanfirefox , but remember in CS2030S, a `Stream` is useful once and once only. `.foreach()` is a terminal operation, and stream operations stop there and cannot be operated on further. You would need to call `.stream()` again from a `Collection` which may introduce quite a bit of overhead.

However, that being said, we should worry about getting it right first, before starting to optimise. Also do note sometimes _verbose_ code is better as it displays logic clearer. I think that your expression is ok.

I do not really see much value in removing a lesson. Do note Scheduler is only called and adds enrolled `Lessons` from a `Person` whenever any of `meet`, `study`, `eat` is executed. We are also not caching a Timetable at all. Note that `Timetable` is also created in that moment of need only.

@mynameizzhafeez for our context, each student who is enrolled in a Module will not be expected to be enrolled in all classes. Perhaps changing `Module` to `EnrolledModule` makes it less confusing?

@mynameizzhafeez I designed my code in a way such that when @kennycjy integrates his `Module` implementation into `Person`, then empty `List&gt;Timetable>` implies No person added. Notice when that happens, no timings are recommended. This results in a `CommandException`. Note that from your implementation, rightly so, when `.execute()` is called, participants are added to your list of `Person`, if no valid `ContactIndex` is there, then it also results in `CommandException`. Does'nt it seem to already have quite a number of gatekeeping?

@mynameizzhafeez For example, we both take CS2030S, it could be interpreted as the _same_ Module in **layman**. However for our context: `Module` must be seen as such:  it should be noted that each of us have different Lab, Tutorials and Recitation slots, so think of what slots we got during MODREG, package them into `Module`. so the CS2030S `Module` that Person A has would be different from that of CS2030S `Module` that Person B has because the enrolled slots (from MODREG I guess) are different!

## TODO + extension to tag.
Tag should check if the tag exists already.
Throw exception when tag exists but getting tagged again (Tag already exists)
Exception message should show what tag is present + disallow execution (even if its multiple tagging at once)

Similarly for untag
Untag should check if tag is actually there, else throw exception : E.g Tag not actually there

Ensure duplicate tags in command will throw exception.

I think its better NOT to change typical events. Some existing test might rely on the fact that `DRAG`'s date is after `CARNIVAL`'s date. 
Even if it okay during this commit, future tests might depend on this (new) fact that they have the same date. Eventually, (existing and new) tests will depends on different "facts", thus likely to bring around bugs. (When that happens, it would be crazy hard to debug having to dig into commit history).

I think we only need to use this once somewhere. 
Apart from that, I feel that it would be better to use `assertEquals` as it make more sense to whoever reading the code. (Doesn't pause the reader and make them question why you are using a roundabout way when there is a cleaner `Assertion`  method to use).

This was originally abstracted out, since it applied for a few commands. Having the information at only one spot makes it easier to "maintain" (future modification only need to update one place).

The calendar UI acts as a value-added feature and is not meant to totally replace the `find` feature, which allows the user to focus directly to a specific day.

Regardless, an enhancement is required if we do want to fix it, which unfortunately cannot be due to the feature freeze.

If user is not experienced in JAR/Java, it would be better not to directly modify the local storage.  In additional, it is not advisable for user (experienced or not) to directly modify the local storage, as user might change the data incorrectly and introduce bugs into the system.

Currently, in MainWindow#executeCommand, `CommandException`, `ParseException`, `InvalidDateException` are caught and log/print error message. Inside the catch clause, `throw e` continues to throw the error to the method which called MainWindow#executeCommand.

In this case, CommandBox#handleCommandEntered is calling MainWindow#executeCommand. Inside the `handleCommandEntered()`, `CommandException` and `ParseException` are caught and and handled (no more throw, so the exception stops here). However, `InvalidDateException` is not caught and handled, thus continues to be throw until its causes 
a `InvocationTargetException`.

To resolve the issue, just simply catch `InvalidDateException` along with the other 2 exceptions in CommandBox.java line 49.

> LGTM apart for the clarification I have left. Asserting same object to be equal is universally true. Would it be redundant?

@russelltankaimin The original AB3 test implementations mostly include asserting the same object to be equal too, just to add on to probably why @mynameizzhafeez  included the test in. It is not necessarily redundant as well if you check the implementation of equals in the particular object, as some of the `equals()` methods have been overridden to check whether they have the same values.

INDEX should not be in square brackets as it is not optional

also, maybe you want to add a tip that delete's index is relative to the current recipe list that the user sees (even after find!)

e.g. suppose i have a recipe with name "abcd", which has index 3 in the original list. after i run `find abcd`, this recipe has index 1 in this new filtered recipe list. if i call `delete 1`,  this would actually delete recipe "bruh" even though its not index 1 in the full recipe list

hm I feel like the `commonName` and `substitutions` should belong to `Ingredient` instead of `IngredientQuantifier`? cause those belong to the ingredient itself and is not necessarily recipe-specific

looks ok, but i think we are massively over-complicating this by allowing non-numerical quantities ("a", "one") cause then we have to parse it too

also if you wanted to make it simple we could just require ALL amounts to be of the form `[0-9]+.?[0-9]*` (i.e. a decimal) so we don't have to go through 3 levels of regex checking,,, 

but anyways the code looks fine hopefully the additional complexity doesn't introduce any more bugs into our input validation,,, need to test this comprehensively cause there are many possible behaviours

minor comment: i'm assuming fields that aren't filled in will just be empty strings "". since we aren't using optional types, i believe that this means that the empty fields will still be present in its JSON representation? 
e.g. 
```json
"ingredient": {
  "ingredientName": "beer",
  "commonName": "",
  "remarks": [],
  <etc>
}
```

it's not a major issue, but if we have time then it might be good to use optional types instead so those fields won't be serialized if they're empty

1. Recipe Details: text overflows past the bottom of the popup window, with no scrollbar visible

3. Edit form: for short recipes, the initial window created may be too large for the contents, leaving this white space at the bottom

- **fix for #236:** doesn't work on my end. even though no recipe card is selected (and highlighted in blue), pressing the "delete" key still prompts me to delete. if i confirm the deletion, the first recipe in the list is deleted
- **fix for #220:** verified working
- **fix for #225 and duplicates**: edit form ingredients still use `a/`, and add form ingredients are still empty. looking at the commit history, it looks like commit 9cdbdf9 is named wrongly? you may want to investigate

I don't think we're allowed to change this due to feature freeze! We're not allowed to touch any part of the GUI unless it's to fix a genuine bug :O in our case, even if we keep the default width as 740, the user can still handle the truncation by adjusting the window themselves.

Step 6. The user now wishes to perform an undo ten times. The user executes the `undo 10` command to undo ten steps. However, only two iterations of the tracker data are popped from the `TemporaryMemory` primary `Deque` and pushed into the auxiliary `Stack`. Because only three `DengueHotspotTracker` states exist, only two undos are possible.

It's commented out because the test is failing for some reason, even though it seems to work fine on the app! Would like to keep it there as a reference to come back and work with.

My rationale for creating a separate predicate for `delete` is because `delete` can only take in dates and date ranges anyway! Reusing the find predicate would work, but would require one to pass in `Optional.empty()`s for the name, subpostal, etc. arguments each time, which felt a bit messy and unnecessary.

Maybe one way to combine the two while still keeping the code succinct / readable for `delete` would be to have an overloaded constructor in the combined predicate class?

I'd personally prefer keeping the two predicates separate for neatness' sake! Even though they have very similar functions, DeleteDatePredicate can specifically only take in date and date range.

I'm not keen on having to create empty Optionals for the name, subpostal, etc. arguments each time I use the predicate for the delete class. I've just tried defining overloaded constructors for the current FindPredicate, but it seems a bit strange to have overloaded constructors just for date and date ranges and not for any of the other parameters of the FindPredicate.

It helps with asserting that index and predicate are not both present! If a predicate is always present regardless of whether a date has been taken in, there isn't a convenient way to check whether or not a date has somehow been taken in along with an index.

Changing to Inter is right. But i think you should check with Jia Hui where the parts in the other CSS need to be changed. Cause if im not wrong, there are other parts that uses this font-family name. Perhaps it will be better if you use the find function to find in files for Intellij.

Tested with phone number. 
What i did:
Add Phone number 1900 to client 1 and 1090 to client 2.
Used command: find p/19.
Returned filtered list only has client 1. 

Perhaps you may want to check which will match. 
Should probably be '19' will match '1900' and '0190'

Cannot use these in the UG. All these examples are from your own data set. Perhaps it will be better if you mention what attributes will it return.

For example, 'find p/91234567' returns 'every clients with phone numbers containing the string'.

Wait. Nvm. It is better to store it in client since it is the weight history of the client. You may ignore this comment. But i think it is better to store the weight object in the weight history and make a new weight object when there is a new weight. what do you think?

Technically is not a bug. Invalid Command format is right. As stated in the parameters, it needs to be a positive integer. 

However, found a bug where too many integers like this 10000000000000000000000 will cause it to be invalid command format. May add it to dg v1.4 as Planned enhancements.

I just took another look at `ObservableValue`, turns out there are some subclasses we could potentially use.

[`ReadOnlyObjectWrapper`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/beans/property/ReadOnlyObjectWrapper.html) can provide the observable wrapper for a `User`, and return an unmodifiable property to a getter with `ReadOnlyObjectWrapper::getReadOnlyProperty`.

I was also considering having multiple `User`s for different people using the same app, but that goes against the tP constraints so never mind.

I would recommend against wrapping this as an `Optional&gt;Index>`. Not only do all its dependencies have to accommodate this change, but they also have to do a `null` check that ends up throwing the same exception, which isn't ideal.

However, note that this involves abstracting a `Field` that is inherited by all the fields, with a `contains(Set<String> keywords)` method.

Also, `Set<Tag>` will have to be made into a `Tags` class inheriting `Field`, so that it works in the polymorphism above.

As mentioned in `Person.java`, this method can be abstracted into a `Field` abstract class or interface (same applies for the rest of the fields).

I don't think the current implementation of this method aligns with its header comment. From what I see, it returns `false` the moment one field does not contain the corresponding keyword.

For e.g., given two persons `n/Abc p/12345678` and `n/Def p/98765432`, the command `find n/abc p/9876` will show neither person instead of listing both.

With regards to which behaviour we should adopt (AND or OR), this is less straightforward as it depends on the use case. For e.g., if you want to find all the Gmails tagged as profs (`e/gmail t/prof`), you would expect the AND behaviour to filter out non-Gmails and non-profs. On the other hand, if you want to find people who have either school email or Telegram for your next event promotion (`e/nus c/tele`), then you would want the OR behaviour.

Ultimately, we should be fine either way as long as it's clearly specified in the UG.

Although these work, they go against the design of Observables as the stored value is extracted before it's used and the UI is updated manually with the `execute` method. Usually, an Observable would be used in a way similar to:

```java
logic.getSelectedPerson().addListener((observable, oldValue, newValue) -&gt; {
    bodyPanel.getAddressPanel().getPersonDetailPanel().setPerson(newValue);
});
```

This seems to use `ReadOnlyObjectWrapper` as a simple wrapper instead of an Observable. In this implementation, every time `getSelectedPerson` or `getSelectedIndex` is called, it returns a new instance of `ReadOnlyObjectWrapper`, and previous listeners on prior invocations of these two methods will not receive the updated value as `ReadOnlyObjectWrapper` is never informed of the update (because the two setters change the local variable but the wrappers still hold references to the old values).

Usually, `ReadOnlyObjectWrapper` would be used like:

```java
    private final ReadOnlyObjectWrapper<Person> selectedPerson = new ReadOnlyObjectWrapper<>();
    
    public ReadOnlyObjectProperty<Person> getSelectedPerson() {
        return selectedPerson.getReadOnlyProperty();
    }
    
    public void setSelectedPerson(Person person) {
        selectedPerson.setValue(person);
    }
```

You can refer to [`TabUtil`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/ui/tab/TabUtil.java) for a similar implementation.

Also, I feel like keeping the selected `Person` is enough, as `PersonListPanel` can search through its list of `PersonListCardData` and select the first one with a `Person` that matches, and the index is also stored in the class.

Actually, instead of having the the chain of getters, I think have a `BodyPanel#setSelectedPerson(Person person)` method is better as follows the law of demeter (don't talk to strangers).

So something like:
```java
logic.getSelectedPerson().addListener((observable, oldValue, newValue) -&gt; {
    bodyPanel.setSelectedPerson(newValue);
});
```

Referring to the subsequent comment, since you know the selection changes when the listener is triggered, this part can be moved into the listener and `CommandResult` may not need to keep track of whether the command is for selecting.

Referring to the comment in `MainWindow.java`, `BodyPanel` can have the following method that propagates the selected Person to its children.

```java
    public void setSelectedPerson(Person person) {
        addressPanel.setSelectedPerson(person);
    }
```
</panel>

<panel  header="**67 :octicon-git-pull-request::octicon-comment:** (commented on others PR)" popup-url="https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/pull/138#discussion_r1149315114" expanded>

Similar, `AddressPanel` can propagate the selected Person:

```java
    public void setSelectedPerson(Person person) {
        personListPanel.setSelectedPerson(person);
        personDetailPanel.setPerson(person);
        personDetailPanel.setDisplayedIndex(personListPanel.getDisplayedIndex());
    }
```

Additionally, `PersonDetailPanel` would no longer need to be passed into `PersonListPanel`, as `PersonDetailPanel` is informed of selected Person changes through the common parent `AddressPanel`. However, `PersonListPanel#getDisplayedIndex()` would need to be implemented.

Alternatively, `PersonDetailPanel` can take `PersonListPanel.PersonListCellData` that already contains the index, replacing both its `setPerson` and `setDisplayedIndex` methods.

With the propagation of the selected Person, `PersonListPanel` would have the following method:

```java
    public void setSelectedPerson(Person person) {
        for (PersonListCardData data : allData) {
            if (Objects.equals(person, data.getPerson())) {
                personListView.getSelectionModel().select(data);
            }
        }

Also, this listener will have to inform the model of changes in selection by the user clicking, so that the info propagates to all the relevant UI components. Something like this within the callback:

```java
Person selectedPerson = personListView.getSelectionModel().getSelectedItem().getPerson();
logic.setSelectedPerson(selectedPerson);
```

I think the tester is saying how nonexistent calendar dates get bumped down, for e.g.:
* `2023-02-29 -&gt; 2023-02-28`
* `2023-02-30 -&gt; 2023-02-28`
* `2023-04-31 -&gt; 2023-04-30`

Perhaps this behaviour was desirable in the design of Java's `LocalDateTime#parse`, hence I think we should describe this edge case in the UG.

Nobody wants to be *that* guy, but I think we can use `StringBuilder` here instead of the normal `String` class.

Since `String`s are immutable, each `+=` is actually creating a new `String` object.

Do we want to have more "real" examples in the user guide? I was thinking something along the lines of:

"
Suppose Jacob Lim is at position 3 with email jacoblim@yahoo.com, phone number 97671263, /\*other information\*/. After you run `copy 3`, the following text will be copied to your clipboard:

```text
Name: Jacob Lim
Email: jacoblim@yahoo.com
Phone number: 97671263
/* other fields */
```

Note: if the FAILS is unable to access your clipboard, it will display all the person's information in the *forgot-what-name* box. You can then highlight the text using the mouse and copy it to your clipboard using `Ctrl + C` on Windows/Linux or `Command + C` on Mac.
"

With regards to the last point, I also thought it would be good to tell the user what FAILS would do if it couldn't access the clipboard. After all, where else are we going to tell the user about this fall-back function?

```puml

deactivate CopyCommand

The hidden arrow forces the `X` to move lower.

Steps to reproduce a bug I found:

1. Use the default `addressbook.json` data (you can simply delete the old `addressbook.json` file and re-open the app to achieve this)
2. Run `favorite 1`
3. Run `favorite 2`
4. Run `find alex`
5. Run `delete 1`

Outcome: in the Favorites list, Bernice is now at index 0.
Expected outcome: Bernice should be index 1 (to match the numbering when running the `list` command).

I think this behavior is caused by the `indexOf()` returning `-1` to denote "not found", but because of the `filteredListPersonIndex + 1`, it becomes `0`.

Do we want to shorten the `COMMAND_WORD` from `"favorite"` to `"fav"` to make typing the command faster? Though, this would mean that the name of the `*Command.java` file doesn't match exactly with the characters that the user types into the Command Box lol.

> @rexcyrio @minosx31 @niekis Fixed all tests broken by the new fields, Gradle is building now. Regarding field-specific tests, maybe we can add those in future iterations?

I think we should add the test cases for `Rank` now rather than in future iterations.

It doesn't really make sense to "accept" a new feature only to introduce test cases for the feature later on -- are we saying that we accepted a potentially buggy feature previously?

Maybe one good test case to have is to check whether we accept `"pte"` (i.e., lowercase characters instead of uppercase characters).

I think we should reconcile the ordering of the fields for consistency.

Since @jugheadjones10 has coded the Java code following the first screenshot, I think we can update the UG to match it (plus, it makes more sense to have the optional and repeatable `[t/TAG]...` be at the back)

Current implementation:

:x: `r/3sg`

Leon's proposition:
:heavy_check_mark: `r/3SG`
:heavy_check_mark: `r/3sg`

I think accepting lowercase `rank` is a good idea -- it makes the life of the person typing in all the information easier.

-----

**The problem that I was trying to get at**

Suppose at one point we show:

```text
edit 1 n/Henry Tan r/PTE 
```

to update the name of the first person to "Henry Tan" and his rank to `PTE`.

Since the users are used to seeing
- `NAME` to denote the name of the person
- `ADDRESS` to denote the address of the person
- `RANK` to denote the rank of the person

Will they misinterpret the `PTE` in `r/PTE` (which is in all UPPERCASE letters) to denote "the pte of the person"? This might be seen as a bug in the  user guide (i.e., using ambiguous symbols) if the graders wanted to nit-pick really hard.

For long names, we can simply let the text break to the next line -- is this possible for tags too (i.e., a very long tag name breaks to the next line)? Though, I am worried that it may not be viewed as a single tag item anymore cause of the line break *within* the light blue tag box.

Alternatively, maybe we can just set the max length for tags at 100 alphanumeric characters? Then we won't face the overflow issue anymore.

I just realised that most of your event commands reference 'Person' / 'person'.

The method has been changed to check by Id field only, that's ok right?

Another consideration if there is a need to check and guard against duplicate phone numbers / email here like in AddCommand and EditCommand. I think might not need (**not entirely sure**) since those technically can be assumed (like at this stage, there shouldnt be anyone with duplicate id, phone, email fields) and here we just need to avoid same id (i.e same employee) from being added twice. Or we could also add for defensive programming?

There's probably quite a number of possible combinations and test cases, especially when adding and editing employee since we want the flexibility of editing any field yet maintain 3 primary keys.

Is this your own manual test method?

@kennethk-1201 @jerrrren Y'all may want to avoid using Employee Equals method when testing if a person exists in an event / department. If im not wrong, in the scope of our app, we define two employees to be the same as long as their IDs are the same. So this check is handled by isSameEmployee.

The equals method of Employee right now checks every single field. Perhaps if i override the equals method, do y'all think its better? Still, technically there's nothing wrong with this strict equality definition uh, just not applicable to the definition of our app. Also `delete` commands use this Employee::equals as per the original AB3

Same concern as before, what if the edited person changed its phone number (or email) which clashes with someone already added to the event? Will there be checks in place?

By right, your part shouldn't need to concern with this because when the user edits a person to have duplicated email/phone fields, there should be an error thrown before your part of editing a user in an event list kicks in. Worried there might be integration issues but if the flow is as above, should be fine right..? Or should we have defensive checks also lol

What is the expected behavior if i re-add Alice into the department? Think it would throw duplicateEmployee error as well, which is desired.

Just a minor point, at this stage of adding employee into departments, all employees should be valid and not have any clashing identities fields so perhaps it is more reasonable to test adding the same person object to department. But nothing wrong with this testing on id field uh, just that it raises eyebrows why not test on email and phone fields

Perhaps we shouldn't encapsulate this in a try-catch block. There is no need to to edit the message to include MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT (this is handled in the above also) since the error here is incorrect format of ID which is thrown and handled by `ParserUtil.parseId`.

This way, we also standardise with the other commands that handle incorrect formatting of a specific field.

The only command that deviates from this currently is your `EditDepartmentCommandParser` where &gt;preamble> is not formatted but you want it to be in the format of a department name but didn't include PREFIX checks

Ok nice check. In practice, this will only occur for corrupted files right? Where the 2 supposedly same Employees somehow have different fields in SudoHR UniqueEmployeeList from that of department's UniqueEmployeeList.

After thinking about it, im not sure if this design is good. Would we be targeted on this? Or is there any justification why we should create 2 separate references of the same object?

Best way i can think of changing this is in JsonAdaptedDepartment.java, we dun call e.toModelType() but just track the employee id. 
Then in JsonSerializableSudoHR, as we process the employees in SudoHR, we maintain hashmap&gt;ID, Employee>. So, rather than checking corruption of data, we add the employee to the department employeeList here since we can access the same object using the hashmap above.

Pls see comment below too (last one), so u can consider both sides. 

But one justification for having two separate Employees of the same kind i can think of is if we support uploading of data files in the future. So SudoHR isn't booted from scratch but with existing data. Then it makes sense we probably have to create 2 employee objects, one for department and one for the main employee list and check against corruption of data

you can consider using parserUtil.parseDepartmentName because this field is essentially looking for department name. The parser util method should help handle error too.

I recommend having an additional test cases that include PREFIXES e.g in the other test file like DeleteCommandParserTest, it takes into account cases where additional fields (prefix fields) provided. 

Not sure if the intended behaviour of the error message is NAME not formatted correctly or invalid command usage. I think the former aligns with most but do check it out! Thanks

also for DeleteCommandParser, that is the expected behavior right? The handling of redundant argument i believe falls under the regex for each prefix and tokenizer.

so eg. name fields should not allow '/' something like:
id/77 n/andre r/abc e/... a/.. p/...
would fail because name field is andre r/abc, '/' is illegal. This is just a simple example to check against expected behavior.

yup, if we are checking against invalid leave dates, there are two kinds:
1. invalid characters like %**
2. dates that simply do not exist e.g 30th feb. This might bring about question of leap years but i believe java date time library handles that so 29th feb in the year 2020 is valid but not for 2021

Discussed offline. This way of checking may result in unwanted behavior. E.g editing a person to have different id.

Would be nice to have 2 reviewers (@kennethk-1201 @pkwangjoo @jerrrren) to go over the changes (so dont need one person view all but up to you). It might be easier check by first looking at test cases, then link to the required implementation.  Most of the test cases are written from scratch, but once the testing logic for UniqueEmployeeList is out, the testing logic for ModelManager, SudoHr is somewhat similar, save some tweaks.

Here are some points to take note too:

1. I've done testing for almost all of them - ModelManager test can be further tested once gui is up since it involves messing with userPrefs settings. EditCommandTest can be added with more test cases - but for now its fine because the underlying implementation of UniqueEmployeeList (**note** the corresponding test file is UniquePersonListTest) has been heavily tested.
2. There is ALOT of inconsistencies in the naming across all files because several of the test files (and some main body code) actually wasn't renamed properly in the previous PR. Sorry that some parts still reference person while others have switched to employee. My new test cases also sticked with 'person' to avoid confusing myself and inconsistency within the file. Once this is merged, i'll raise another PR to resolve all these naming inconsistencies.

SLAP and design can be *a lot* better

- Each model can have a `toDbSchema` method and inherit from a `JSONAdaptable` interface
- In the constructor for this, simply pass in the field objects natively and call the `toDbSchema` as opposed to overloading the `toString`
  - Can also have these fields be an `Optional` to set the JSON if present
    - RecipePortion
    - RecipeDuration
  
- Each model can also have a `fromDbSchema`

Please add refactoring of the fields - feel free to ping me or anyone for what fields we should store in an Ingredient, but my intuition for now is:

```java
Ingredient {
    String item

RecipeIngredient extends Ingredient {
    double amount
    Optional<Unit> unit
    Optional<HashSet<Ingredient>> substitutions
}

Step {


}

Tag {


}

RecipePortion {

RecipeDuration {

Recipe {
    List<Step> steps

we can do this, so there will be no ambiguity between similar alphabets. i think this is better too, as it provides greater clarity on the flags we're specifying. 

perhaps we should create an issue to reorganize all the existing commands such that:
1. flags follow `flags:f/`

This is expected for v1.2a (which is going to end by this week!). Adding an `elderly` and a `volunteer` will add it to the `UniqueElderlyList` and `UniqueVolunteerList` respectively, but these lists are not yet shown on the UI. We will implement this moving into v1.2b and v1.2c!

Actually, I think this is better since we're planning to put `Nric` in `Person`. If not, there'll be a lot of duplicate message. Instead,

The logic here doesn't seem right. This `filteredList` is the list that will be displayed on the GUI. By calling `model.updateFilteredElderlyList(predicate)`, you're effectively updating the UI to only show the current elderly that is being deleted. Take a look at `MainWindow.java`, line 117. Instead, what we can do for this PR is to map the corresponding elderly index to the elderly NRIC. If it is too much trouble, a trivial way would be to do an O(n) loop for now and search it through the list. 

Do write a `// TODO:` for future fixes.

Hmm, we probably have to discuss this tomorrow during our weekly meeting. Do we want to separate the commands for pairs, elderlies, and volunteers? Or have a one-fits-all approach?

I'm on the fence about whether or not a warning message is required since there is no meaningful way to inform the end user that the message is a warning. My suggestion would be to add an attribute to `CommandResult` which informs the UI component whether the result is `SUCCESS, WARNING or ERROR`. However, I'm not sure if this will introduce any breaking changes, nor is it worth the effort. What do you guys think?

Yup, I agree. I vaguely remember that `Volunteer` should have some attributes, but I can't recall now lol.

Btw, @wz2k can you confirm that the `MedicationQualificationTag` is now no longer a tag? If so, can you create an issue and update the current one in the main branch?

Yup, i agree with this. We can remove it if it's unnecessary. I think the `delete_elderly` keyword is already sufficient to identify that this is meant for elderly.

This seems to be caused by not checking if `viewedStudent.size() == 0`, the error goes away once I add an if statement to check for such case, however still need to observe if there's any more bug.

Just a suggestion, but in such cases where exceptions are not suppose to be expected, can just add a `throws Exception` to the method definition so you don't have to write this catch block.

May I know what is the intent of this argument? Seems like it might be breaking the convention.

If the goal is to specify a flag (a value that is either true or false), would it be better to just have a prefix for that flag? For example, if I have a flag for find command that toggles whether I'm searching by tag, would it be better to use a `/searchTag` prefix where the value of the argument is irrelevant (will be ignored)?

Then when parsing the arguments, we can make use of the `ArgumentMultimap.getValue(Prefix)` method to retrieve the `Optional` with the prefix for `/searchTag` and check if it was specified using the `isPresent()` method of `Optional`.

Understand that you're trying to line wrap your text. However, best to check if they will render out correctly after line wrapping due to markdown using line wrap as a form of formatting (it isn't like java where new lines are ignored and lines only end with `;`).

Manual line wrapping in markdown can become problematic especially when you're doing it to point form lines (lines that start with `-`). If you're not too sure how to handle all these properly, using no line wrap is probably fine I think. Don't think the 120 line width limit applies to markdown files.

Interesting insight. If there was a long 100 hour video that the user is meant to watch part by part weekly, the user would have to be required to watch over 7.5 hours of content per week. Although this is not impossible, it seems unlikely to occur or might be extremely rare. As such we will consider this a "nice to have" and not a "functionality bug"

We will be updating the user guide to include this limitation.

We feel that giving the user more freedom is good but will have the tradeoff of making development harder and also opens the door for more malformed input attacks.

It will also make command parsing harder as we would have to carefully choose what is include-able and not include-able which also makes it harder to communicate to the user via the user guide.

Agree that not all video players will show the seconds. We feel this is a "nice to have" rather than a "functionality bug". Currently, it is possible that the user could enter 00 for the seconds portion and it will not cause too much hassle on the user's side.

The current `Quick Start` section feels a bit too bloated. It feels more like a `Command Summary` then a `Quick Start`. Perhaps, we could strip out less important details and only include things like:
- Navigation
- List
- Adding
- Deleting
- Mark/Unmark
- Tag/Untag

Possibly can simplify each further by not mentioning the `/mod` and `/lec` arguments since navigation would already serve that purpose. Think of this as what is the most basic things that a beginner needs to know. For more advance information, can just leave a disclaimer (refer to {section} for more information).

I believe they are actually supposed to be trimmed, since the proj name passes through this fn.

    requireNonNull(source);
    String trimmedSource = source.trim();
    if (source.isEmpty()) {
        throw new ParseException(Messages.MESSAGE_EMPTY_STR);

    return trimmedSource;

this is a good idea, but re this predicate thing, seems like it's existence is coz AB3 has a `find` command to find person from their name

we're gna adapt this to do sth different in the next iteration, so it's prolly best to just leave it as is for now to prevent double work. i suspect we'll be able to delete the whole *ContainsKeywordsPredicate thing

maybe can just add  TODO or NOTE to come back and refactor it later, and merge wat we have currently

re the testing of `updateFilteredClientList` and `updateFilteredProjectList`, we can have independent tests for them i.e. not inside this big `equals` test, maybe a separate `updateFilteredClientList_allTrueFilter_doesNothing`, `updateFilteredClientList_allFalseFilter_becomesEmpty` etc etc

maybe can create an issue to remind us to add these tests? this one no rush tho can be for the next milestone

I think ur misunderstanding what the test is trying to test. It's trying to assert that the trimming is actually done. So for something like

these two calls to getFiltered*List retrieve direct references to FilteredList which live in ModelManager. so it's not very convenient to use, since for fuzzy, we require boths sorting + filtering. it worked ok for AB3 since they only had to support `find` command. but for now this shd suffice, i'll figure sth out aft finishing my part

@StanleyNeoh 
> Is this preferable to the letting the LocalDate just fix the date itself to an appropriate date (turning 31/02 to 28/02)?

idt we should assume that the date is 28/02, and not 13/02, 31/03, etc.

> It seems that it doesnt really solve the issue as there is no warning also (same as the corrupting data in storage)

i think it counts as corrupt data, so we can treat it the same

could we do instead of having it append through all the prefixes, even if user did not fill in the argument for that prefix, we have it cycle the current unfilled prefix until user fills something?

something like: if the input is currently `exportm` and user presses `TAB`, it becomes `exportm m/`. If user does not input anything for the prefix `m/` and presses `TAB` again, it should cycle to `start/` so it becomes `exportm start/` instead of `export m/ start/`

hmm we should also compare the time if `meetingTime` is not `null`? if one `DateTime` object has `meetingTime` and the other does not have, then it makes sense to take the one which does not have any `meetingTime` to be just `00:00` (midnight) of that specified day.

        String lastPrefix = argsSplit[argsSplit.length - 1];

        ArgumentMultimap argMultimap = ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(" " + lastPrefix, PREFIXES);
        boolean returnNext = false;

        for (Prefix p : PREFIXES) {
            if (returnNext) {

            }

Tested with every field because I was worried the message might be too technical for normal users, but the messages are well-done. 
One problem: Invalid input in the `portion` field sometimes returns `unknown command` or has no error message instead of command format error. E.g. inputting `1swag` in `portion `can give `unknown command` or no error message while not adding.

Same issue occurs in the 'name', 'duration' and 'portion' fields for 'edit form', except 
deleting the field returns the format error message. E.g. deleting '10.0 minutes' under 'duration' returns 'A Recipe's duration should consist of an integer/fraction/decimal section and an alphabetic time unit (spaces allowed)'. And 'deleting name' should return a more informative message, like 'recipe name cannot be deleted, to delete the recipe, press d on the recipe card.'
No issues on the steps, ingredients and tags though.

Nope, returning `null` here is okay because the method `getNextTextField()` is designed to return the next TextField below the current one if it exists. The method that calls it (`removeNewRow()`) also already handles the `null`, so its okay in this case.

> this is an issue when you try to submit a multi-line command but the cursor is not on the last line. pressing "enter" will add a line break instead of submitting the command, leading to an error

I've attempted a fix but I'm not sure if it's possible due to it being a textArea where the default behaviour to entering when the caret is not on the last line is to add new line. 

Actually I think that it might be more appropriate for users to only enter when their blinking cursor/caret is on the last line, and similarly, adding a new line by entering in the middle can be a feature, not a bug. And if we follow this line of thinking, then we just have to update the docs and result display message.

Looks alright to me, but could I ask if the implementation of RemoveCommand is such that it checks for the presence of flags, and removes the relevant field in such a case? Curious because I don't believe any input aside from the particular flag is necessary for the attributes address, email, profile, phone, (assuming name removal is not allowed, but do share your thoughts), while languages and tags would wipe the entire set if nothing is specified, and only the particular tags/languages in the case that any input is given. Does the current implementation accept flags with inputs e.g., `a/someaddress`? Perhaps should consider further discussion with the others as well

> e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as   (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

So the individual `...` do not refer to the line as a whole being extended, rather, it indicates that the individual items may occur multiple times, and I believe it should be present behind both

Was initially considering implementing this method under `UiManager`, however, that requires the `HostServices` returned from `getHostServices()` be passed to `UiManager`, which I felt was not ideal as it would cause the same instance to be accessed across multiple classes. I settled on having it be implemented here such that if necessary, other windows may open URLs by using the static method.

@huanghao1998 , should we consider removing steps 1 and 2, as they conflict with Extension 3a? I added a similar UC for redo with that in mind, however, if you feel like it is necessary I will change UC14 to follow the format for UC13

I think the current implementation of commands for persons are distinct enough that there’s no need to merge the use cases (within those concerning persons), so the usage of “Similar to use case x except…” would be for the equivalent project commands excluding assign and unassign as there’re not really equivalents.

I agree on the inclusion of specificities, so just off the top of my head the key things we’d have to include would be:
* applied to projects instead
* potentially different extensions

Since the use cases themselves exclude lower level details and such of the implementation, the use case equivalents for persons and projects would appear similar after all

I have traced through this `new FriendlyLink()` and noticed that it doesnt do anything useful until it is passed down from `StorageManager.readFriendlylink()` to `JsonFriendlyLinkStorage.readFriendlyLink()`, which calls `JsonAppStorage.read()` which calls `JsonSerializableFriendlyLink.toModelType()`.

Both `JsonAdaptedPerson` and `JsonAdatedTag` takes in `FriendlyLink` in their `toModelType()` method but does not do anything with the `FriendlyLink`.

Perhaps `new FriendlyLink()` should call the toModelType() method of serialisableEldery and serialisableVolunteer , instead of being passed down all the way from `MainApp`? This way we can reduce the number of times friendlylink is passed into inner methods without doing anything extra.

If we use entities we would need to specify 2 different ids. If we specify a pair, we can use the id of the pair. Id of pair seems easier to use and quicker to type.

Both nric is null can be used to check for all pairs in friendlylink, which might be useful in the future if we add other commands that can potentially edit multiple entities at once

I have considered abstracting this out to different functions, but it appears to have too much repeated functionality since  `checkIsSameRegion` and `checkHasSuitableAvailableDates` would both require null and non null versions for elderly and volunteer

To do:
* Add a UI mockup of your intended final product. Note that the image of the UI should be named docs/images/Ui.png. Limit the file to contain one screenshot/mockup only and ensure the new image is roughly the same height x width proportions as the original one.
 If we did the above update correctly, UI mock up and profile photos should appear in our project website and this [Project List Page](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/website/admin/teamList.html).
* Update all contents to match our project.
* Update the link of the GitHub Actions build status badge (Build Status) so that it reflects the build status of our team repo.
* Acknowledge the original source of the code e.g.,
`This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).`

```suggestion
MATHUTORING is a **centralised desktop application used for private Math tuition teachers** to manage their students' contacts and performances which subsequently allows the tutors to plan their lesson plan for future lessons and overall view of their schedule for ease of planning. While the user interactions are conducted through using a CLI, it still has the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MATHUTORING can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

did you mean one instance of the `List&gt;Person>` or `PersonListBuilder`? Also, in order to render this a singleton class, you'll need to implement other measures to prevent the calling of the constructor again, other than making it private

E.g. maintain a static count/boolean value for whether an object has been initialised. For this reason i don't recommend the use of singletons

Only issue with this regex is that it does not catch leading or trailing white spaces. However, you can use `&hat;(?=.*[a-zA-Z0-9])[a-zA-Z0-9]+(?:\s+[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*$` to solve that problem.

The filteredCardList is basically a FilteredList instance of the current list of card in the current chosen deck. So i guess whenever we switch deck we can create a new FilteredList instance of that deck?

Instead of getting the selectedDeckName here, do you want to bring it to the Command::execute method?

I may be wrong but I think this method is unnecessary. The field currCard only stores a reference of the card. If you assign the currCard to a different card, the original card whose reference was stored in currCard will not be modified. 

And I dont think there is a reason to change the reference inside currCard, since it will not be reflected in the UI anyway. Correct me if im wrong tho sirr

Ohh I agree with you on 1 and 3, I just thought 2 was not necessary. But now I realised number 3 uses `IsSameCardPredicate` to filter the list, which uses Card::equals instead of Card::isSameCard, hence tags are compared too! I personally think isSameCardPredicate should use Card::isSameCard instead, so 2 can be removed.

I agree, though initially I thought of handling null here as a sanity check only. The only usage of `getSelectedDeckName` right now is in SelectDeckCommand, and I am not sure if handing null check there violates any SLAP or abstraction principles.

Is this to prevent cards that exist without a deck? Currently this check is missing. I can add this check and update ASAP.

To clarify, you propose this check be made when the app loads the save file? 

Currently, this check may not be needed at the saving stage because the app demands that a deck must be selected (by extension, created) before a card can be created.

`updateItem()` in ReviewStatPanel will be called everytime the ObservableList `reviewStatsList` is modified. Current when we call the method `updateReviewStatsList` in Review, the Observable List is modified twice (clear, then add). Is this potentially the source of your issue?

According to QnA, if the message is incorrect, you can claim it as a bug. The current message says the limit must be a positive integer, which is techinically not fully correct (100000000 is a positive integer but not allowed).

Thanks for the clarification!

Would "must contain at least one letter" account for "cannot be blank"? Then, we'll only need the "must contain at least one letter" condition.

For the second point, I think the cannot-be-blank condition can be specified in the UG's "Notes about the command format" section. Something like:

* Input parameters must contain at least one non-whitespace character (i.e. blank inputs are not accepted)

I was following what they did for PersonBuilder :P I thought it was useful because I use the same functionality for 6 classes and didn't want to repeat chunks of List-building code. It may be more LoC, but it's far neater, I find.

Do you mean to say that all the Person instances in the List are the same? They each have different properties! The main idea is for us to be able to feed in, say, a List of 5 Postal codes and have the Person instances with those Postal codes be made for us, without having to go through PersonBuilder 5 times.

Sorry, not too sure what the issue is here. Could you clarify what you mean by "condense everything into one function"? Like, `public PersonListBuilder with(String dataType, List&gt;String> values)`?

Could perhaps follow the format of how `AddCommand` includes optional prefixes `"[" + PREFIX_DATETIME + "INTERVIEW DATE]...\n"` to indicate that the DateTime prefix is optional (and only needed when advancing an appliant from `APPLIED` to `SHORTLISTED`.

I like this method of checking whether or not DateTime prefix is needed by the user - since they would only need to input if they advance the Applicant from `APPLIED` to `SHORTLISTED`, and in every other Status, the `interviewDateTime != null` Nice!

If I remember correctly, methods should start with a verb. 

Perhaps we can rename the method to make it more obvious that the method is used to convert the DateTime into a readable format? I'm thinking `toFormattedString(LocalDateTime datetime)`, since this method is pretty much doing the same as LocalDateTime's `toString()` method but instead in a readable format

I think we can consider adding a new class called InterviewDateTime instead of using LocalDateTime. 

So that we can make the InterviewDateTime's `toString()` be in the `toFormattedString()` that I suggested earlier. 

This is so that we can avoid having to call `toFormattedString()` separately and can simply do `InterviewDateTime.toString()` to call the formattedString.

The reason why I abstracted out into several methods is because we need to check 2 situations for each case for when the user inputs or doesn't input `InterviewDateTime` so I felt that it would be better to let a method handle each check. 

If `InterviewDateTime` was provided by the user, then we would still need to check whether 
1. `Status == APPLIED` && `!isDuplicateTime`.  If both true then no problem
2. `Status != APPLIED`, then we would throw a CommandException with `Messages.MESSAGE_INTERVIEW_DATETIME_NOT_REQUIRED`.

If `InterviewDateTime` wasn't provided by the user, then we would again check whether:
1.  `Status != APPLIED`, if true then no problem. The reason why I use `Status != APPLIED` instead of `Status == SHORTLISTED` is so that in the future if we ever want to add anymore intermediate Status, this condition still holds true
2.  `Status == APPLIED`, then we will throw `CommandException` with `Messages.MESSAGE_INTERVIEW_DATETIME_IS_REQUIRED`.

@4ndrelim , I think this one can leave it separate from your current issue for now. Although it is important to settle this early so we don't have a repeat incident, I'm thinking we can split this consistency problem of "sudohr book" based on who is handling which component, so we don't have the crazy merge conflict problem again.

Should do conditional check first, eg:
'departmentList.stream().filter(d.contains(employeeToDelete))
        .forEach(d -&gt; d.removeEmployee(employeeToDelete));'
        
As Department uses UniqueEmployeeList internally now, Department#removeEmployee throws EmployeeNotFoundException if employee does not exist. Hence, a conditional check should be done first to check for employee existence in department.

As per the other commands, I think you should follow the standard of throwing a custom ParseException that contains DeleteDepartmentCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE. Otherwise, I'm not sure if the error displayed on SudoHR will display to the user how to use the command properly.

You can do this by defining a `arePrefixesPresent`method to check missing prefixes before parsing, or handle with a try-catch block, so that you can throw a ParseException with the custom message.

In my opinion, relying on memory address of an object couples everything too tightly. However, I honestly can't think of a concrete example where this coupling is a hindrance. We can discuss this in the future if needed, but I genuinely don't think it's an issue and makes everything clearer, because playing with a single reference might risk leading to unintended side effects imo.

Another argument is that current implementation has "final" fields. There's not much advantage to using single reference as you have to replace them anyways.

I think we dont need an Optional<Index> here. I used Optional<Index> for the PersonDescriptor because the EditUserCommand may not have used Index. But since EditEventCommand always uses the Index, no need to add another layer of complexity to it.

Perhaps this could be in the above section for javadocs and for the `@return` section you could use the return variable name and explain what it is.

This implementation seems quite complex. Perhaps you can consider the cases in which the Event can occur between the period:

2. Start before/equal to start of period && end equal/after end of period

Might want to add a few extra conditions for this:
```
A year may be a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4. 
Years that are divisible by 100 (century years such as 1900 or 2000) cannot be leap years unless they are also divisible by 400. 
(For this reason, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 were.)
```
The above was taken from Google

Hi @lywich , I check the properties of the folder and it's indeed read-only, but I'm not sure if it's the real cause as the folder containing my own group project for testing is also read-only but the error doesn't show up. 

```Could not save data to file: java.nio.file.AccessDeniedException: C:\WINDOWS\system32\data```
Btw, this is the full error message. 

I have also check for the folder properties of system32, it's also read-only. There's no data folder present in the folder system32.

Should you need any further clarification, please @ me in following replies. Thanks

@lywich There's only a jar file within the folder, the log is not found. Moreover, I found that me as a user in fact has the read & write access to the folder storing the jar file, despite the folder's read-only attribute is true.

Not all objects get deleted at end of parsing of a command, but rather they exist through the lifetime of the appllication. For example, the `LogicManager` and `InternBuddyParser` objects do not get destroyed after the command executes, but they are reused for parsing for commands again.

Hi @kohkaixun, great catch! It was my mistake, I did not think of that situation. I have edited the `edit` command accordingly where if the user wants to delete a comment, he can just write `edit INDEX c/` and the comment will revert to `NA`. This is consistent with how tags work for the `edit` command:

Looks good to merge for now. However, we need to discuss these for v1.3b.

1. Is there an inconsistency between `find` and `clear`? Kai Xun implemented `find` where the user can do `n/` multiple times. So to find for entries for both `Apple` and `Google`, the user has to do `n/Apple n/Google` and not `n/Apple Google` because he does an exact match. Can we finalise how you guys want to do it? It's quite important to settle this for v1.3b.
2. You might need to update the right panel UI after doing `clear`, in the event that the entry shown in the right panel is deleted via `clear`. I have already implemented it in `delete`, so `clear` probably needs to be updated as well.

Looks good to merge. I think we need to include in user guide that within the upcoming week is inclusive of the current day. So for example I set an entry whose date is `2023-03-30` and that's not considered within the week. Would be clearer to state in the documentation.

I think the feature looks great! However, it's a bit complicated now so you probably need to explain very clearly in the user guide. This is because for index matching, you do it based on OR, so `delete 1 2` deletes both internship entries 1 and 2. However, for the cases of "pure predicates" and "index and predicates", you do it based on AND.

I get your rationale in choosing AND, and I think your choice is jusitified. However, please explain it step by step with examples of each case in the user guide! 👍 

Also, the description for `delete` command is not really accurate. The part on `only the selected internships whose company name...will be deleted` is not exactly correct, where it should not be the company name that contains the other information. Do you think we should explain the cases in this description as well, or leave it to the user guide?

Will there be an inconsistency in your predicate matching using AND?

- I can delete 2 internships by doing `n/CompanyOne n/CompanyTwo`. This is based on OR and not AND.

Will it be too confusing to the user? I realised `find` also has this problem.

I thought of another issue. Your `delete` doesn't seem to search for internships in the unfiltered list where it does searching through the filtered list. This is inconsistent with `find` where `find` does searching in the unfiltered list.


Suppose I have the following data:

Then, I run `find n/Apple`.

Then, when I run `delete n/NewCompany`, no internship would be deleted.

@seadragon2000341 

Thanks for raising it up! Actually I did not make it longer because I couldnt solve it initially. I managed to solve it already, can you see whether it's better? Also, thanks for mentioning it, it made me realise I forgot to make the width of the labels for `CompanyName` and `Role` in the right panel responsive. 👍

Hi @seadragon2000341, prof replied on the forum already. In my opinion, it fits the definition of a bug because:
- The screenshot that I took in the forum is when the window is maximised on my 14-inch laptop.
- In both the left and right panel, we cannot see the full details of the truncated text. This means there is no way for the user to be able to view his information.
- The situation would be worst for people with 13-inch or smaller laptops.

Do you think we should accept this as a bug fix then? Maybe the others @DerrickSaltFish @potty10 @kohkaixun can weigh in too!

I chose `rule` because it sounds simpler, from the CS2101 feedback someone said `constraints` a bit complicated. I don't mind changing back to `constraints` if you guys think it's better. @potty10

@seadragon2000341 

The `createEditedInternship(internshipToEdit, EditInternshipDescriptor)` is a static method of the class `EditCommand`, so I believe it should be making a call to the **class** `EditCommand` instead of an object of `EditInternshipDescriptor`.

Referring to the tutorial notes, it should look something like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86542359/230725657-8df7fa63-00bd-4d31-80c3-122b3d68a5a3.png)


Does it make more sense if we amend it as such?

Maybe we can consider not having the `status` attribute in `EditOrderDescriptor`. Since the edit command does not allow a change in status, the Order's status attribute should always remain the same. Also, the status attribute on initialisation is always null based on its current usages. Thus, the status attribute in the descriptor feels redundant.

Would adding the date parser here only be better?

To localise the date parsing logic to one method.

Although DOB and other related fields requiring only the date which can be represented by a `LocalDate`, I believe that `LocalDateTime` can do the same by assuming the time to be 000hrs of that day. By using the same method to parse dates, I believe that it will aid in our endevours if we choose to add relative date parsing as well as all the parsing logic will just to have to be in this method which will be called by other classes that requires dates to be parsed. Relative parsing like `today` (today at 0000), `1500` (earliest day at 1500 from now), etc.

I suggest something along these lines

```java
else if (datetimeString.matches(DATE_ONLY_REGREX)) {
    return LocalDateTime.parse(
            datetimeString + " 0000",
            DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(FULL_DATETIME_PATTERN));
}
```

where `DATE_ONLY_REGREX` will be `\\d{4}-\\d{1,2}-\\d{1,2}`

During a manual start up of the app, `NullPointerException` was thrown but I believe this is the cause. The `id` in the FXML file will have to be changed to match these names and also added for the extra 2 `FlowPane`.

I think the tags for `allergies` and `vaccines` might not display properly (just as a basic label) since in the css it is only set to style the labels of stuff coming from 'tags'.

Would the use of `TagFlowPane` to store the tags here be better so that the tags are styled as tags instead of text labels with less typing?

I believe this should work:
1. Change the type of `allergies` to a `VBox` or `HBox`
```java
@FXML
private VBox allergies;
```
2. Replace the code for allergy here with:
```java
allergies.getChildren().add(new TagFlowPane(patient.getAllergy()));
```
3. Repeat for `vaccines`.
4. Update/Add components in `PatientListCard.fxml`.

Would `getZeroBased()` be better here since this method will be called by other parts of the application to retrieve the patient withint `PatientManager`. Patient keys in `PatientManager` are zero based integers.

Maybe we can change it to return an `Index` too so as to allow for more flexibility.

Would this be better to check if the patient is present as `getFilteredPatientList` only shows the map view of what is visible. `model.getPatientManager().getMapView()` I think will return the map view of the current unfiltered state of patient manager.

Map<Integer, IdData<Patient>> lastShownList = model.getPatientManager().getMapView();

If `LocalDateTime` is used, the deserializer will auto parse it for us like in appointment. It will only be able to parse the default date time format `yyyyMMdd'T'hh:mm` but I think it is okay as the JSON file is meant for advanced users.

As for serializing, it will serialize in the default format as well. With the time part.

Here is how appointment serializes its dates when `LocalDateTime` is used:

I think this check is too strict. It invalidates all appointments that has already passed. So during loading if there is one appointment that has already passed, that appointment will be seen as invalid although that appointment may be valid at the time when it was added.

For example if a valid appointment with start time `2023-03-05` is added on `2023-03-04`, on `2023-03-06` this appointment will no longer be valid and none of the saved appointments will be loaded.

I suggest using `VaxChecker` to validate if the patient can take the vaccination:

```java
Patient patient = patientList.get(toAdd.getPatient().getZeroBased()).getValue();
VaxType toTake = vaccinationList.get(toAdd.getVaccination().getName());

List<VaxType> patientHistory = patient.getVaccine()
        .stream()
        .map(vaxName -&gt; vaccinationList.get(vaxName.getName()))
        .filter(vaxType -&gt; vaxType != null)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

Age patientAge;
try {
    patientAge = new Age(LocalDateTime.now().getYear() - patient.getDob().value.getYear());
} catch (IllegalArgumentException illArgEx) {
    // if for some reason the user decide to turn back time on their system
    throw new CommandException("Patient contains an invalid DOB");
}

HashSet<GroupName> allergies = new HashSet<>(patient.getAllergy());

boolean isTakable = VaxChecker.check(toTake, patientAge, allergies, patientHistory);

if (!isTakable) {
    throw new CommandException("Patient cannot take the vaccination");
}
```

I think this should be done for edit command too.

I think `KeywordManager` should not extend `StorageModel` here as the uniqueness of the names of the keywords is requried. I think a different manager model (but similar to vaccination) will have to be used.

Also, by storing each keyword individially in this map would it then require searching the entire map if a keyword exists? Would using a map of a `String` (The user defined keyword) as the key and the `Keyword` as the value be better.

Eg.

```java
public class KeywordManager {
  private final HashMap<String, Keyword> keywordMap = new HashMap<>();

  public KeywordManager() {
    // constructor
  }

  // add, remove, set map methods

  public String getKeyword(String keywordString) {
    if (!keywordMap.contains(keywordString)) {
      return keywordString;
    }
    return keywordMap.get(keywordString).getMainKeyword();

  // asUnmodifiableMap method

I suggest using a `|` to represent mutually exclusive argument. So for this find syntax it will be something like this:

```html
patient find {PATIENT_NAME | [--n <var>PATIENT_NAME</var>] [--p <var>PHONE</var>] [--d <var>DATE_OF_BIRTH</var>] \
    [--b <var>BLOODTYPE</var>] [--a ...<var>ALLERGIES</var>...]... [--v ...<var>VACCINES</var>...]...}
```

However this makes the argument quite long and I think breaking it up can aid in the presentation so this:

```html
patient find {PATIENT_NAME | [--<var>ATTRIBUTE_FLAG</var> <var>FLAG_ARGUMENT</var>]+}
```

and a separate part maybe below to explain what values the ATTRIBUTE_FLAG can take and its corresponding argument.

The `|` is from google CLI documentation style ([here](https://developers.google.com/style/code-syntax#set-of-two-arguments)) which is what our presentation is based on. We might have to add an explanation for this in the CLI presentation section as well. Using one line to present an argument I believe is much better than using 2 lines which may confuse the user.

I think this can be fixed by making the test method as such:

```java
    @Override
    public boolean test(Patient patient) {
        String name = patient.getName().fullName.toUpperCase();
        for (String keyword : keywords) {
            if (!name.contains(keyword.toUpperCase())) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```

Edit:
But I think it will break quite a bit of test cases....

I tested it. Smoke test works I think as intended but it fails this test case.

Which I feel should be the expected outcome as
```
patient find Bob Carol

should find only names that containts BOTH Bob and Carol.

Its intended!! Ingredients (allergies) no longer supports the requirement syntax (ie. NONE:: ...) since its requirement can only be none. So its syntax follows the groups (--g) in vaccination or allergy (--a) in patients. But I think I can improve this by giving the syntax on errors as well.

As in the comments, special characters will have to be converted to escape characters else errors may result.
Also code presented her is case sensitive. To make it insensitive convert both `text` and `patternString` to a single case.

I made it in a new separate folder instead of integrating it as I do not know where this should go.

I cannot review the UI picture but it is not an accurate start up image. But take the picture when the application is started fresh. Meaning delete the data folder and then start it up and take that image without entering any commands. That picture is suppose show how the application when the user first starts it up.

@vsamarth For conditional rendering, perhaps we could attach a boolean to each component, and only render it if the value is True? Seems like we could do it with JavaFX [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19666982/is-there-a-way-to-implement-a-property-like-rendered-on-javafx). For convenience, I'll just link the issues that tackle conditional rendering here: #15, #16, #17, #18, #63.

If you're planning to remove `Chatable`, then you probably won't need to change the message representation either :>

Also I forgot to test `open 1 tg/ wa/`, would that end up opening both Telegram and WhatsApp?

with that in mind + the tester mentioning that it doesn't actually send the message, do u think reverting to the original (i.e. not having the "send message" part of chat, and just having the prefilled message) would be better in this case? or do u think u can find a workaround?

I tried doing it but its not practical because you have to use ```String.format``` and the second argument you have to put ```"elderly"``` which is a magic string and to solve magic string you would have to declare ```String ELDERLY_STRING = "elderly"```. You have to do the same for volunteer and ultimately you end up with more strings

> @AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-1/developers hey guys, do you think it's better if we store all data in 1 file, `friendlylink.json` or separate them out to their respective jsons, e.g. `volunteers.json` and `elderly.json`?

I feel separate files are better but it really depends on the complexity of the changes that needs to be made to the current code base and the test cases needed to ensure our code stays bug free.

Would need to include these new parameters afterwards. 
Also, not sure if intentional but might have missed out adding status to requireAllNonNull(...) method.

The other Person constructor should not need any changing as I assume merging both our branches will rectify any differences.

> @evanpy please consider adding in extra validation for phone numbers. IMO, it's ok to restrict the number of digits to strictly 8 and assume that it's a Singaporean number, as long as we make it clear in the UG. An arbitrary restriction to the number of digits might be strange (and possibly reported as a flaw).

Will make the adjustment, but will settle with digits ranging 7-15 instead of 8 since we accept leads across countries.

This file tests all the cases for execute but doesn't test the other 3 methods:

1. `getPlatformToDeleteObject()`
  a. returns the correct `Optional&gt;Platform>`
b. returns an empty `Optional&gt;Platform>`
3. `createEditedListingWithoutPlatform()`
a. returns the correct `Listing` object 
5. `equals()`
a. `true` case
b. `false` case 

I mean its not the main purpose of the DeletePlatformCommand class but if we want higher % in codecov then need. Also depends on the testability of it like `hashCode()` is quite retarded to test lol

Same for this ugh if we want full codecov coverage for this then need these testcases:

- [x] `parse_validArgs_returnsDeletePlatformCommand()` - This test ensures that when valid arguments are passed, the `parse()` method returns a `DeletePlatformCommand` object.
- [x] `parse_invalidIndex_throwsParseException()` - This test checks if a `ParseException` is thrown when an invalid index is provided as an argument.
- [x] `parse_missingIndex_throwsParseException()` - This test checks if a `ParseException` is thrown when the index is missing.
- [x] `parse_missingPlatformPrefix_throwsParseException()` - This test ensures that a `ParseException` is thrown when the `PREFIX_PLATFORM` prefix is missing from the input arguments.
- [ ] `parse_invalidPlatform_throwsParseException()` - This test checks if a `ParseException` is thrown when an invalid platform is provided as an argument.
- [ ] `arePrefixesPresent_allPrefixesPresent_returnsTrue()` - This test checks if `arePrefixesPresent()` method returns true when all prefixes are present in the given `ArgumentMultimap`.
- [ ] `arePrefixesPresent_missingPrefix_returnsFalse()` - This test ensures that `arePrefixesPresent()` method returns false when at least one prefix is missing from the given `ArgumentMultimap`.

Should we return "None" here? I think can consider doing away the `orElse("None")`.
Ie we just do `Optional.ofNullable(selectedDeck).map(Deck::getDeckName)` since this will return an empty Optional object which we can apply `isPresent` if we require to check if there is a value.

Can chagne store changes to MasterDeckStorage.
I think it is calling hasDeck before calling addDeck in Model.

Yup. The reason why I commented it out was because our selectedDeck is null, so it fails during gradle:test as it was calling `null.getCardList`. I amended it in a hackish way for now. 

But I was thinking, do you think we should initialize this at the start? Cause when the model is first created there won't be any selected deck actually.

Actually, I agree with @rockman007372, the parse method should only take in userInput and not additional parameters like selectedDeck. Cause a parser's role is to parse user commands.

 I suggest passing the card creation to AddCommand instead of this class.

I think the test to determine if a command is invalid or valid is only applied at the Logic/Parser level under LogicManagerTest.java.

you're right. but because for `null` we can't use `.equals` as will invoke a `NullPointerException`. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4501061/java-null-check-why-use-instead-of-equals.

something like that

```
return getQuestion().equals(e.getQuestion())
                        && getAnswer().equals(e.getAnswer())

From what I understand, there is the original list ('internalList') and the 'filteredCards' is an 'UnmodifiableObservableList' that listens to the 'internalList'. And what's pass to the UI is the 'filteredCards' and not the 'internalList'. 

1) 'masterDeck.tagCard'changes the 'internalList' directly, meaning now the 'internalList's' old tagged card is replaced by the new tagged card. 
2) 'currReview.setCard' alters the 'currCard' so change will be displayed with 3)
3) 'updatedFilteredCard' updates the 'filteredCards' (dependent on the 'internalList') and the way it updates is based on the new 'currCard'

if I am not mistaken, 1) and 3) must go together because 3) depends on 1) changes since 'filteredCards' observes the 'internalList' of 'masterDeck. For example if I remove 1) then no actual change is made to the 'internalList', ie the changes are only displayed. 

2) is required too. If I don't update the currCard, the old 'currCard' won't match any of the 'filteredCards' since now the 'filteredCards' contains the new currCard with the new tag.

Last time I thought we can just use 1) but because 'UnmodifiableObservableList' is only a read only list, it won't update immediately when there is a change in 'internalList'.  2) and 3) is required to so called "update". 

I may be wrong! But I did try removing 1), 2), or 3) and found that it only works if all are present.

@rockman007372 hmm if I'm not mistaken it is not a must to set predicate for the filtered card list after tagging for the UI to be updated dynamically. For example if we use the edit command to create tags for a card, the cards shown will be updated once the change has been made. 

I think if the list is an observable it will listen for any change in elements within the list and the UI will update accordingly.

Ok so switching from an `OR` search to an `AND` search? I'm not sure which is better actually.
I think the benefit of the current implementation is that it is more flexible. For example, if I want to only search for `How` and `What` questions I can just do `findCards how what` which can't be done if we implement the `AND` search.

I think I may prefer the `OR` search actually because I don't see someone typing `findCards what is a loop` as they probably just type `findCards loop`. But we can discuss with the rest too!

To implement `d [-p] [-t <tag>] <task>`:

- Set the priority of the task to UNKNOWN
- Set the set of tags attached to the task to an empty set

We need a "builder" object to hold these information (what priority to be deleted, what tags to be deleted, etc). You will need a class like:
```java
class DeleteCommandRequest {
    public boolean shouldDeletePriority;
    public Set<String> tagsToDelete;

    // ... getters
}

In the command class, we will use the getters to "retrieve" the information and act on the object accordingly.

This is expected. We no longer uses -t (for tag), and we will not allow the user to sort with title.

Yea, I think can close as out of scope because patients may have existing vax that this branch of vax center does not manage.

Prefix has been changed to m/ instead which represents merge
- By default, all existing values will be overwritten

Since `Region` is now optional, could you also modify the `isMatch` method such that any region successfully matches with a `NOT_SPECIFIED` region? Alternatively, modify the implementation of `addPair(Elderly, Volunteer)` in `FriendlyLink` and the `getCompatiblePairs` method in `AutoPairCommand` to accommodate for `NOT_SPECIFIED` region. 

The reasoning behind this is that given a volunteer which does not have a specified region, we should reasonably be able to pair it with any other elderly regardless of the elderly's region, and vice versa.

I need to add it though. There's the `resetFriendlyLinkData` method in `FriendlyLink` that's currently not setting the elderly and volunteers. Another way we can do this is have `ReadOnlyFriendlyLink` extend `ReadOnlyVolunteer` and `ReadOnlyElderly`. The latter way is probably better.

Looks good, although there'll be some conflicts between this and #49. In #49, I added `ModelStub` as a static class under the `CommandTestUtil` class, while here it is in its own separate class: which would you prefer? Additionally, the `Person` needs to be replaced with `Volunteer` in the relevant areas.

Okay, here's what I'll do: for #49, I will revert my changes to `ModelStub`, and just add it as a static class to `AddVolunteerCommand`. After I merge in the PR, @Zxun2 could you settle the conflicts? Sorry for the trouble.

That's a good point @glozxi, as of our current implementation, it only allows for phone numbers (originally was >3 characters, must be number). I'm concerned that implementing use cases like `1234 5678 (HP) 1111-3333 (Office)`  will affect how we define contact (given that a contact has a `name` and a `number` and the way the linkage is made.

Had a few question in mind, these questions are a duplicate of the questions i asked in PR #151

1. Should we sort the UG in lexicographic order? (Alternatively, we could prioritise a few important commands for the user experience such as the `clear`, `newcontact` and `newevent` command, especially for first time users)
2. Let's include warning for the `clear` command as it is a destructive command that could wipe out the user's data
3. Let's include some form of starting guide in the message area for first time users to look at? For example:

Since you're utilising the same `projectToMark` object here, it will already have had its status set to `DONE` before calling `MarkProjectCommand`.

This is short enough that you can flatten it to `String.format(MESSAGE_PROJECTS_CONTENT, model.`);

Doing a `String.format` is unnecessary, as you may notice that `MESSAGE_PROJECTS_CONTENT` is just `%s`, so you're essentially just replacing it with `formattedMessage` in full. You can directly use `formattedMessage` as the `feedbackToUser` of the `CommandResult`

### Display birthdate in person cards

Currently, when users provide a birthdate for an Elderly or Volunteer profile, only the person's current age is displayed in the app. To view the specific birthdate, users must refer to the respective JSON file.
We are looking into including birthdate in each person's information card as well

Currently, there are no limits on the number of tags or the character limit for each tag. If large number of tags or tags with excessively long names are used, it affects the UI display and impact user experience.

Therefore, in v 1.5, we plan to limit each tag within 50 characters, with the total number of tags being less than 10.
This would ensure decent degree of input flexibility, while not severely clogging up the UI display.

Currently, users need to mouse over the pair card to view information of each pair. This reduces the efficiency of FriendlyLink, which is intended to be optimised for typing.

I think we should implement a private variable in Patientist for the PersonList and the getPersonList in Patientist to return this list as a unmodifiableObservableList so that we can make a make a FilterList with it. Then we add a new method to Patientist to clear and refresh this variable instead and consequently refreshing the FilterList as well.

Maybe it might be better to make it as Jin suggested to always have 3 columns? Or maybe we make it such that when we lsward, we make the predicate of filteredpersonslist always false so that filteredpersonslist is empty and all index commands do not work until you list the persons again.

Our current display of the role tags is displaying them placing them together with other misc tags. When we use edit command to edit tags, it removes the displayed role tags as well. Role tag variable in patient or staff remains unchanged.

Yep simplest solution is just a ui fix. Need to remove some logic components to stop adding the role tag to normal tag set though.

For the validation regex, use the following instead for `ItemCost`, `ItemPrice` and `ItemProfit`:
`    public static final String VALIDATION_REGEX = "&hat;-?\\d*\\.\\d{2}$”;`

Use `Double` instead of float.

Reason:

For `ItemProfit`, we are using the same `VALIDATION_REGEX`. However when we calculate profit:
```
Double a = 5.00;
Double b = 1.00;
Double profit = a - b; // profit will be 4.0, NOT 4.00 (INVALID regex)

agreed with `commonName` being under `Ingredient` because it is likely to be shared/common across all uses. However for `substitutions` it is okay to leave it under `IngredientQuantifier` because it could be recipe specific (while cooking noodle soup, light soya sauce could substitute salt for example but you can't exactly sub out salt for light soy sauce in the case of making french fries - so it can be recipe-specific)

Would it be better to initialize `commonName` to the name of the ingredient instead of leaving it blank? Then if there are any "more common names" in a sense then we can set it using `setCommonName` like how it was intended to be.

Could the class name be `IngredientInformation` instead? Since quantifier brings the meaning of expressing quantity and we already have a separate `IngredientQuantity` class, might be misleading.

Will have to view it as a markdown doc to decide but in general, the guideline should be that the diagram text should be roughly the same size as the body text of our DG (so I think in a sense you can gauge).  Although I still suggest moving the adapters into a separate portion because right now its the part making the diagram so skewed toward one side, not sure if we should try to centralize the `&gt;&gt;interface>> Storage` for neatness?

Don't think it appears on the DG site eventually but for neatness should try to follow the `<img src="xxx" width="xxx">` format, and perhaps from there you can adjust appropriately the diagram size(s).

I believe the filtered list just creates a list with an observable list and a given predicate. See the constructor:
```
public FilteredList(@NamedArg("source") ObservableList<E> source, @NamedArg("predicate") Predicate<? super E> predicate) {
        super(source);
        filtered = new int[source.size() * 3 / 2  + 1];
        if (predicate != null) {
            setPredicate(predicate);
        } else {
            for (size = 0; size < source.size(); size++) {
                filtered[size] = size;
            }
        }
    }
```

In your test you can just create a FilteredList stub and add it to the ModelManager stub, from there should be simple to script out test cases.

`select` is not used in the conventional sense here, it follows the same convention as the other two boolean state variables `showHelp` and `exit`. 

It is supposed to represent the state of the command being entered.

I think this is easily addressed with tags. You can use tags to identify user's items. To show all wesley's items, we can use `listbytag n/wesley`.

Thanks for the link provided. After looking at it and reading some examples, I understand more.

For this issue and the previous issues (named 'label'), I feel to keep it simple, we can only have something as 'midterm' instead of 'Midterm Assessment 1'. The main use of this is to plot a chat at the end, so keeping it to only one score may be more meaningful.

The reason is:
if we have 'Midterm Paper 1', we may have 'Midterm Paper 2' and so on, then we may need to think about calculating the total score of these different papers. Maybe we can focus on implementing the `AddScoreCommand` first, then gradually add these features.

`\n` and `\t` are not flags but rather the newline and tab indentation. `n/` (the name field flag) is required since find command now accepts all field flags, so we need to specify which field we are searching on.

In this particular case, we will be searching on the name field.

If there are no flags attached to a keyword (or keywords before any flags), find command will throw an error/

There isn't a need to currently, the `parseMeeting` method in `ParserUtil.java` handles the parsing of user's input. I have added it here for possible future extensions.

After considering, maybe it would be better if I remove it, since I don't think it is wise to create methods that isn't use, to prevent possible error usage or abuse.

Will update it when I'm free.

The code will generate a new Task with new `TaskId`, which will break your taskAssignment Mapping.

Just a suggestion, Since everytime we need to create a new task object for editting, I think it would be better if we have a factory method in task class that can help us to clone a new object, in addition the factory class can enforce the isSame relationship easily.

Agree with Yiting, too many different command may confuse the user.

However after v1.2, it is clear that we only left a few CRUD features need to implement which is likely to be fast.
Thus we can consider our next focus areas.
Currently my suggestion is either we focus on GUI or the conveniency of commands
Here are the examples:
- GUI
    - We can consider interaction effect such as click effect and animations
- Conveniency 
    - Make the command more natural
           - Instead of `addtask Biking` or `add Peter`  we could use `add task Biking`  or  `add person peter`. 
           - Instead of `review 1` or `reviewtask 1` we could try `review person -i 1` and `review task -i 1 `
           - In addtion to the index review we could also add `review person Peter` or `review task Biking` if there is ambiguity we will display to result and ask the user input the index, thus a multi step command is needed.

> What happens if I have 50 tags? Do all the 50 tags line up in a horizontal row such that all 50 tags will be displayed to the user? Will the tag be too narrow to read the tag name properly?

The current implementation will try to squeeze all 50 tags in a single row but this would mean that the text inside is wrapped in such a way that it may not be readable.

I could change it back such that the tags would still flow nicely and remain readable but would probably need to set a length restriction for the tags.

# Current `find` command & its limitations
Currently, `AB3` already have a find feature, although with some limitations:
- can only find words within the person's name 
  *(ie. u can't filter via tags, address or phone)*

- can only search whole words 
  *(eg. `find ale` will not return person `Alex Goh`. u need to enter `find alex`)*

- keywords are forced to be logically-OR with each other 
  *(ie. `find alex goh` returns `Alex Goh` and `Calvin Goh`)*

# Suggested plan
- implement ability to find/filter by tags/user-info
  *(eg. `address:choa chu subject:math` or `a/choa chu s/math`)*

- allow partial-word matches
    *(eg. `find ale` returns `Alex Goh`)*

- updates the filtered list on every user input *(b4 user enters the find command)*
  *(ie. when user types `find ale` without pressing `Enter` yet, app auto updates the list to match)*

# Current `AB3` autosave feat.
`AB3` already autosaves any new/edited person's info. So this feat. is pretty much done.

# Suggested improvements

The only things that we could expand on this is the things below. **But both of them is low-priority / not important**

- autosave currently entered command 
  *(eg. User enters `add n/PARTIAL_ENTERED_NAME` and exits the app. Next time the app opens, it will fill in that partial command)*

- autosave last command's output
  *(eg. User does `find Alex`, app shows only `Alex Goh`, user exits app. Next time the app opens, it will still only show `Alex Goh`, like how it was left off)*

Some suggested changes:
- When user input is received, the `ViewCommandParser` will first check if the arguments are empty.
- If the arguments are not empty, the `ViewCommandParser` will try to extract tokens that are prefixed with`n/`. 
- If a name is not present, it will search for an index (of type`int`) instead.

The CS2109S came a little abruptly, maybe can signal at the front that that is the wrong information.
e.g Say you realise that Amirah does not actually take CS2109S, you can easily remove the CS2109S module tag with the `untag 1 m/CS2109S MONDAY  16 18` command.

I think you can see it as sort of a abstraction for the pages, so this acts as the base of other pages. 
- The `{ content }` in the `wrapper` class of `div` in **default.html** comes from html files that declare layout as `default` (see **docs/_layouts/page.html**). So the entire e.g **page.html** will be placed where { content } is. 
- The DG and UG have layout declared as `page`, so anything that is in there is slotted into where `{ content} }` is in **page.html**

In **default.html** there are 2 divs: 
- `sidebar` is for loading in TOC, it is only used for UG DG now, so the if statement checks for those pages by title, and loads the corresponding TOC html file.
- `wrapper` is the main content, there is a if else to check if it is UG/DG, because it would apply different margins so that the TOC does not overlap with the content. If it is not UG/DG, the page should be centred (so no need to style margins)

I think the predicate shouldn't be set becoz we can start a review at any time (whether a Deck is selected or not) and so when we end the review it should return to the previous state. Ending the review does not change the selectedDeck state so the filteredCards should not be changed either.

I just realised we also need to apply the same addTag operation to the `currCard` in the Review so that the predicate IsSameCard will still hold. ie. we need to apply the same operation to both the `currCard` in Review and the actual card in the MasterDeck (accessible from ModelManager)

See comments below.
The code for ModelManager could look something like this.
```
filteredCards.get(0).addTag(tag);
currReview.tagCurrentCard(tag);
updateFilteredCardList(new IsSameCardPredicate(currReview.getCurrCard()));
```

If I'm not wrong, in ModelManager, u don't need the card index because the filteredCard list should only have 1 card during review (the card under review).

i put the update there to confirm that the IsSameCard predicate still holds true. This is useful for debugging as the app will only behave correctly if the tagging operation done on both the Review's currCard and the MasterDeck leads to the same card. If you can guarantee this invariant with other checks then updating the filtered list is not necessary.

Are there any checks to ensure that the saved decks contain all the unique decks that the saved cards belong to?

e.g. i have 100 cards saved from 10 different decks. i shld guarantee that the deck json has at least those 10 different decks when i am saving the json and when i am loading the json for it to be valid. 

We shld support users directly editing on the saved files (as is supported by ab3), so we need to check the validity of the save before loading.

Thanks for your suggestions! I've edited everything accordingly. For this point, I don't think I'll be making the change since the event tag in the persons will still change in the backend when the dates are edited (just not on the UI display, since we only display the name). Hope that's ok!

I think this should work for now!

Similar to future upcoming fixes for UI (I'm working on it atm) I think we should use Optional&gt;T> class to gracely handle null instances, but let's stick to this for now to get the framework working and remember to fix it for v1.2b.

I was a bit worried about this but after reading JavaDoc for Set interface, it says:

>Returns true if the specified object is also a set, the two sets have the same size, and every member of the specified set is contained in this set (or equivalently, every member of this set is contained in the specified set).

So it compares every Skill and Module in respective sets, and since their `equals` method have been well implemented, this should work!

I agree with leaving the issue open as you said, we will need to keep updating it. However, it seems that the automatic grading system that tracks our tP progress seems to require us to close the issue first, so why not we close this one first since it has met the requirements for our v1.1 and open a new issue for v1.2 and future iterations?

With #47, right panel `InfoPanel` has been implemented to display basic contact info (name) and skeletons for view c/m/s has been created.

Needs to be done for v1.2:

1. Modify `EditCommand` to reflect changes in contact detail immediately to the `InfoPanel`
2. Implement new ways to handle empty contact list instead of instantiating a null `protagonist`.
3. Show other contact details in `DetailedContact` tab.
4. Clean up FXMLs for `InfoPanel`.

Current module code description mentioned in [NUS Registrar's Office](https://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/graduate/modular-system#:~:text=Each%20module%20has%20a%20unique,%2C%20a%20Level%202%20module) is already inconsistent (it says prefix of two or three letters but modules of 4 letter prefix, such as GESS1000, exists).

Due to the inconsistent nature of module code and naming system, imposing more restrictions in input validation will make this a feature flaw instead (overzealous input validation: blocking inputs when it does not hinder operation).

This is not a bug but a feature to allow users to have more valid space for module codes, hence closed.

Shouldn't (leap years % 4 == 0) if it is a leap year?

Also,
> There is a leap year every year whose number is perfectly divisible by four - except for years which are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400. The second part of the rule effects century years. For example; the century years 1600 and 2000 are leap years, but the century years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not.

Adding an additional condition `if (isCenturyYear) {date.getYear() % 400 ==0;}` may prevent this loophole.

hmm ideally id shldnt be decided during runtime like incrementing a counter to act as the id (previous implementation shows it increments as we declare more Vehicles) bcs we need to persist those ids in alot of nested arrays in Customers and Appointments when its saved to the json

we probably just need some helper class to generate unique ids when generating new objects that require id

Main reason is that if there's a different format of a regex we are following, we can apply the validation over. 

And yes now that you say it I think we can do the same for ```scoreValue``` and ```scoreDate``` for code consistency and better abstraction.

This is just the regex syntax. 

```[\p{Alnum} ]*``` (second one) is use to detect alpha-numerical value with spaces,  ```[\p{Alnum}]```(first one) is to handle the case where "" is also accepted.

You can head over [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javaregex/javaregex_matchresult.htm) for more info about the syntax.

Hi @AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-1/developers, 

It is observed that using the `AddCommand` from AB3 to add food items can lead to unexpected behavior, as it currently allows users to add undefined tags to a food item during creation. To address this, I am considering whether we should restrict the tagging of food items to occur only after the creation process is complete. This will prevent users from adding new tags on the fly as they create food items, i.e., creating a food item and creating a tag should be two distinct process.

Would like to hear your opinion.

Actually, thinking about this, deleted pilot makes more sense, because it would be there for undo/redo features. Nevertheless, since we won't be implementing undo/redo in a short while, we can even remove this field. So naming probably wouldn't be that much of a deal.

@AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-1/developers This is related to the link problem that we faced earlier. Since we didn't fix this in the last round, we probably wouldn't fix this in this round either.

Save some trouble. I have two options:
1. We list it as a feature flaw;
2. We remove this feature entirely.
Given that our app has already had enough effort, I think that deleting it may be a good option. If you disagree, then we can leave it here, but we will need to update the DG.

for the tagList.size == 0 case, I thought it wouldnt happen because argMultimap checks that the prefix t/ is present, which means there will definitely be a value for tag, if tag is just a whitespace/non alpha-numeric, it will throw an invalid tag format exception

For these changes, would assigning the person to task based on the actual task list and person list make it inconsistent with the rest of our command such as `delete`, `deletetask`,  `mark`, etc, which is still currently based on the displayed lists instead of the actual lists.

I am not sure about this, because users technically don't have to call `listtask` to get the index, they can delete tasks as long as there are tasks present in the FilteredList. Maybe you can rephrase this?

The arrow representing the return values in your sequence diagrams should be indicated with a dotted line instead of a solid line. You might also want to remove the instance entities at the bottom of the diagram. There should also be a ":" in front of the component labels as they represent instances of those classes.

Apparently multiple keywords will be separated with a space in between them. So names like "Week 1" will not have a full match. This is a limitation of the find command which I will be stating in the user guide.

I noticed this issue only occurs when there is an overflow for row texts.
If we keep the limit of row texts within the frame, this will not happen.

Yes what we meant by optional in this case is that even if not supplied, the command format is valid just that it may not give u the result you want.
However, `find {keywords}` for lectures only works if you are in module context and `find {keywords} /mod {module_code}` does a search from any context.

I thought about it and what the tester has raised is reasonable.
I originally wanted to implement it that way instead of following how its implemented on zsh.

In Command Syntax section point 6, you can update the sentence as below for better clarity. Other than that, everything looks great.

Arguments must be specified in the format `/{argument_name} {value}` if the argument takes a value. If the argument expects no value, the format is in `/{argument_name}`, but if specified, the value will be ignored. Note that there must be a whitespace before `/{argument_name}`.

Actually, I think it is possible in some circumstances for one module to be double counted. E.g. CS1101S has 4MCs going to ULR and 4MCs going to CSF. In the end if I'm not wrong, our CAP should takes into account CS1101S grade for 8MCs.

If I'm right, then we should move line 66 into the `forEach` loop:
```
module.getTags().forEach((tag) -&gt; {
    completedRequirementCredits.merge(tag.toString(),
    credit, (oldValue, newValue) -&gt; {
        return oldValue + newValue;
    });
    currentCredit += credit;

There is some sort of repetition here when we try to list down all the possible values of tags. Perhaps we should make the `enum` for the tags in `Tag.java` to be public and accessible to all?

The `enum` in `Tag.java` can be enhanced to add several methods to obtain the requirement credits for Model to use, short-form (i.e. ULR, CSF etc) for UI to use, tag color (red, blue etc) for UI to use, etc. This `enum` can be shifted to another directory, perhaps `commons`.

Oh, I think the UE cap doesn't have to increase. According to the curriculum [here](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cugresource/per-cohort/cs/cs-21-22/#_ftn2), the 40MCs of UE already takes into account the double counting of modules (e.g. CS1101S, ES2660).

It is originally only meant for the DG to connect each UI component to its corresponding Java class.

In UG, we will just introduce the three screens of the Results Section: Degree Progress Screen, Module List Screen,  Module Search Screen. @Cheamybunny will reflect this change in a future commit.

I have just included a Command Summary section in the UG. Just a few suggestions when I was doing the UG:
- we could change the name of the command `list` (for listing modules) into something more general `show`, which can include specific arguments like `show modules`, `show progress`, `show modules /y y1s1`, etc. When executed, `show` command will display results on the graphical section (left section) of our GUI.
- Instead of `clear` (which deletes all modules), we could move it to the `delete` command, specifying it as `delete all` which deletes all modules. (I think we talked about this the previous meeting but forgot why we didn't agree to this..)

This command can be encapsulated in `show progress` command, which shows the degree progress, CAP, total MCs etc in the GraphicsSection.

But then there will be modules that have tags but no grade.

I think we can categorise our modules into `completed` and `not completed / planning`.
`completed` modules are those modules with tags _and_ grade.
`not completed` modules are modules without tags or grade.

We can then have two degree progress, the `actual` progress that only takes `completed` modules into account, and the `projected` progress that takes both `completed` and `not completed` modules (i.e. all modules added by the user).

_Some suggestions on how this can be shown in the UI:_
- We can have two tabs in the GraphicsSection to toggle both degree progresses.

- In the ModuleList section of UI, we can differentiate `completed` and `not completed` modules something like: 
<img width="400" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-08 at 4 36 21 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87931905/223663697-0a5977b5-24f0-444b-a7bc-072cb746c6ef.png">

On a small note, `Module` class can be updated to include the `isCompleted()` method.

Oh right, I forgot we have a `list` command.

Should we instead change the syntax of `list` command to `view modules`? I think `view modules` is much clearer and more consistent with `view progress`.

Since `view modules` and `view progress` have similar behavior / syntax, we could also have them extend or implement a `ViewCommand` class or interface.

The docs for event commands are very somewhat messy/inconsistent, along with the InvalidCommand help messages
    - some no IE, some no index, some no underscore
    - maybe explain the intuition behind the flags, some might not be obvious to ppl, e.g. f/ for from etc

Not sure if it's for the same bug, but data file isn't updated in the following scenario too:
1. user modifies json file such that task format is no longer valid
2. upon next reload, an empty taskbook is generated (as per UG)
3. when user closes the app without making any changes, json file is not updated, and old invalid format is still present. however, the data will be overwritten when a command is ran.

Yep, I would think so, since it is possible for the user to keep the application continuously running, and it may not 'remind' the user in this instance. However, it's a minor issue since users can still get their reminders by re-running the command (ideally).

Just a note: The owner of the transaction will eventually be dictated by `PersonTransactionMap` (to be implemented in v1.3), so there will be no need to store this in the Transaction class. 

However, indicating the owner (of Person class) when calling the AddTransaction command will still be required, and we can consider calling the index of the owner.

Along with the `isClosed()` method on line 36, it might be clearer if we define static final variables for 'Open' and 'Closed' (such as `CLOSED_TXN` and `OPEN_TXN`), and reference them within the class.

Might also want to consider changing the validation regex to private, since it validation of a TxnStatus is done via the public `isValidTxnStatus()` method.

This doesn't reflect the actual behaviour of the code. From my understanding of your implementation, `addtask` does not check if 'the user is able to add more types of tasks'. There are also no checks for whether a stated task description is empty, or invalid etc. So I think there are no extensions to this use case, unless you wish to add a part about requiring a prefix.

@evanpy please consider adding in extra validation for phone numbers. IMO, it's ok to restrict the number of digits to strictly 8 and assume that it's a Singaporean number, as long as we make it clear in the UG. An arbitrary restriction to the number of digits might be strange (and possibly reported as a flaw).

@wpx12011 please add validation to the Owner, since you have decided that Owner is just a simple String. Check that it is a valid contact as discussed, since we have established that the Owner must match an existing contact as part of the person-txn relationship.

Add whatever changes to the UG please.

@wpx12011 to consider if you want the current definition of duplicate transactions to be a feature. You might want to change the definition of `isSameTransaction()` to just match the same description, to prevent confusion by the user such as this case.

Whichever case, do update the UG as this would clear up their doubts.

I think you followed my changes, which is wrong.
1. change equals_success() to equals()
2. instead of assertEquals(...) use assertTrue(standardCommand.equals(commandWithSameValues))

Using assertEquals will actually make use of the equals method unlike assertEquals, which also contributes to the code coverage

Further explanation: the calendar GUI is meant to provide an quick overview of which day does the user have events within the month. When more than 2 events are happening within a single day, it will show "..." instead of the event name. Suppose the user wishes to have an in-depth look into all events occurring within the day, the user could either use the find command or simply click only the day in the calendar GUI.

compareEvent 13:00- 16:00 --> Throws error

### Recurring Event does not throw error for duplicates and clashing events

The recurring event "Swimming" clashes with "cca" however, no error is thrown. Instead a message shows that the adding of the event is successfully executed and this is highly is incorrect.

Expected behaviour: An error message should be thrown instead.

Isolated event "DateOnFriday" clashes with the recurring event of "cca" on Friday. User should not be able to add event that clashes with the other event type.

Done in face0d08f930d6d77f8f30088cbdcca866dc5e4f. 
But there is another issue: instead of using x.getY().methodOfY() (example below), we had better do x.methodOfXApplyingMethodOfY(), based on lecture content.
```
location.getCrewLink().putRevolve(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());
```

However, this causes code duplication. Given the current highly complex system, we may consider refactoring before enforcing principles.

Need to ensure the following:

1. When flight-related sources (crew, pilot, plane) are linked to flights, they cannot be re-linked to 
a. new flights
b. new locations 
To achieve this, we can add a variable on these objects `isLocked`, set to true when they are linked to flights. 

2. When flights are marked as done, the linked resources are unlocked, i.e., they can be re-linked to new flights or new locations. This means `isLocked = false`. 

3. When location-related sources (crew, pilot, plane) are linked to locations, they cannot be relocated to new locations. Thus, if the user wants to relocate, e.g., a plane, then the plane must be unlinked first. This can be achieved with another boolean `isLocationLocked`. 
But how does the user know where the plane is linked to, given that it is not displayed on GUI? A quick fix would be to save the name string of the location as an attribute of the plane, then the user has to figure out the index of the location to un-link it.  However, if this is the case, we must ensure that there are no two locations with the same name. 

4. What if the user unlinks a resource from flight/location that it is actually not linked to? The current program does not seem to do anything about it. To check this, we can verify whether the flight/location name stored as the attribute of the resource is the same as the name of the flight/location corresponding to the user-input index. 

If we implement it this way, then the name string actually becomes the unique identifier of an object.

The solution is to change our product specification as following:

`link A B` means there is a relation between A and B. If a plane is linked to many places, it means the plane *might* stay in one of the places. If a plane is linked to many flights, it means the flight might use one of the planes for travel. The same for crews, pilots, etc. 

And we dont enfore that all flight-related resources should stay in one place since they can move around.

Correct me if I am wrong: I thought we have deleted the `check` command in our app, as we no longer display `availability`to the users (because ensuring the correctness of availability is error-prone). Since we no longer have the `check` command, I removed it from the UG.

I think this is quite a clever check, but if the other object that is being compared is not an instance of UniqueEmployeeList, i think it will return true? Did you mean to put the `return true` inside the `if (same instance) {...} ` block and default is return false?

I realised that the reason why the cases where additional fields are provided fails for DeleteCommandParser is because it tries to cast the entire string after the eid prefix into employee id. I dont think any of the parser handles the case where we input redundant arguments using prefixes.

Hi @jiasheng59. I was wondering if you could supply us with the logs for this issue so that we can better diagnose the issue. Currently, it seems like a lot of the bugs reported arises from the fact that the application is unable to save its data. We suspect that the cause could be that the file was ran in a write-protected folder.

A simpler solution compared to having an `AddPoints` inner class might be to just return the integer directly in `parseAddPoints` without checking for validity (i.e. allow any integer)

Technically the validity depends on the current point anyway and that is already being validated in `AddPointsCommand::createEditedCustomer` when editing the existing point

`Points::editPoints` can then just accept an integer instead of a `Points.AddPoints`

What do you think?

Saying "you would like to add points..." feels kind of imposing.

Maybe something like "Let's add points..." or "Let's see how you can add points...", or "In this scenario, we would like to add points..." would be more suitable?

There is also a couple more "you would like to" on lines 266 and 267, but the usage for "Perhaps, you would like to..." on line 267 sounds fine as you started with a "Perhaps" so maybe you could do that too

From what I read in Java API, `Period.between` can return a negative value. In this case, `daysFromNow &gt;= 3` will return true as long as the interview date is less than a month ago. Since we only want to remind users of future interview dates, this could be a possible bug!

`Person.applicantDateTime` is renewed everytime a `Person` object is created. When converting from `JsonAdaptedPerson` to `Person` object, this constructor is called again, thus effectively "refreshing" the `applicationDateTime`

What should be done is getting `LocalDateTime.now()` when `AddCommand` is used. Then, we are able to save the actual dateTime the applicant was added (applied). `Person` constructor needs to accept an additional `applicationDateTime` parameter to convert from `Person` to `JsonAdaptedPerson` and vice-versa.

Remember to use 'deleteXYZ' instead of 'deletePlane' in this diagram. Alternatively, you could also just add a line above it, describing how the diagram below focuses on the 'deletePlane' example instead. I did the latter for my diagram.

I think it's because the command appears in a new line for crew mode but not for pilot mode. Can fix by adjusting the markdown file accordingly. Just need to fix for crew mode in 'unlinkflight' and 'linkflight'

@tangyuantyy this isn't a big issue but I couldn't fix it..  I tried `label.setWrapText (true);` in the `CrewCard.java` class but it did nothing. ChatGPT suggested changing the window width and height in case they might be too small which I tried in `GuiSettings.java` class but that didn't make any change also...

Fixing this would violate the feature freeze since it adds additional information to the error message and the example they've given in notes for 'fixes you can't do' is almost exactly the same as this...

Implemented assuming Name is unique in our addressbook. `AddCommand` checks for duplicate `Person` based on `Name` as `isSamePerson()` is implemented that way. Thus, in our addressbook, no two `Person` with the same name will exist.

To finalise what should we show in the toString() of a task,
some samples of `task.toString()`:

1. `OP1 reflection` --> Show only title
2. `OP1 reflection by 2023-04-01` --> Show title & deadline
3. `OP1 reflection by 2023-04-01 !!!` --> Show title, deadline & priority
4. `OP1 reflection by 2023-04-01 under 'ES2660', 'essay' ` --> Show title, deadline & labels
5. `OP1 reflection by 2023-04-01 under 'ES2660', 'essay' !!!` --> Show title, deadline, labels & priority

Also should we display task's status in toString()?

Which one yall find that it makes most sense? To me showing labels & status are kinda not important (and labels might make it looks too cluttered), thus I am more inclined towards (3)

Ok for the part on "Not done" == "In progress",
I think it really depends on the users' expectation,
Cause for some tasks like say "Finalise  event logistics & order on Shopee after getting approval", then it makes sense to have "In progress"

But again, u might argue that they can j break the task down into multiple iterations. 
Personally, I think for completeness (of the status feature), "In progress" is not exactly the same as "Not done", as there is a handful of tasks out there that are subjected to bottlenecks, approvals & other conditional delays.

> This was initially implemented to accommodate `Event` instance `Task`, since we do not have `Event`, every task with a deadline and is incomplete would technically be "In progress" and "Not done" anyways.

As in my argument is that,
the difference between "In progress" and "Not done" task is ultimately depending on user's own use case and his own discretion (on how he wants to use it)

Basically, "In progress" is like an extra utility marker that users can choose to use, or dont use at all

An overdue task must have a deadline. Thats sth we have to agree on first.
Check against current datetime & vimification will auto-marks the task as overdue if its deadline is before the current datetime

There's a checksum for NRIC, but I think there's no need to implement it.

I suggest enlarging the new umls you have included in your new PR by slightly more (maybe 1.3x ?) so that the fonts of the words can match the words in our documentation.

Also, the ### OfficeConnectModel component does not bold and enlarge for some reason :0 could it be due to the sizing of the uml diagram below? 

Lastly, I think it would be better if you can show the uml diagrams ***alone*** on a separate line by itself, instead of saying "API: <Image Here>. What I mean is to leave a breakline between the ```**API** : [`OfficeConnectModel.java`]``` and the image of the uml diagram.

This is what I see:

and maybe this would be better: (note the larger image, matching with the words in DG)

I think it would be better if you could sync the fork to include the latest @Guo-KeCheng 's numbering (as he has labeled each section of the DG with numbers now), and then re-commit the changes for this PR. Resolving the merge conflicts here on the spot may not be a good idea as it may overwrite the git blame of the code (eg. if you modify nicholas's code to include the numbering, the git blame may be pointing to you for his DG stuff instead)

I removed the need to add a valid photo image because I feel it is a feature flaw.

The mapping will instead be done internally to simulate retrieving the student's profile from some NUS database

@ShiJiaAo here are what I have changed: 

- Change the images from url to icons stored (because I feel it is a feature flaw for TA to add photos of students since they do not have access to it)
- Remove PREFIX_PHOTO in methods since TA will no longer use it
- Added attachments to events
- Added dates to events
- Added display of student profile in events when you add students e.g: addStudent 1 Tutorial/Dijkstra (you implemented it, I added the listing of students)
- The command to add attachment and dates example: touch Tutorial/Dijkstra -date dd/MM/yyyy -file FULL_FILE_PATH
- When you click on the event card (I will change the click to a command tmr,) the file attachments will open if it is valid
- Changed some test cases
- Changed prefix of performance from /per to /score
- Add icons here and there and changed css styling to beautify it

@ShiJiaAo yeap I am about to add that in after finishing the DG.
Since the date display on the ui works, I think the time should be doable as well.

I have a suggestion where we could delete all modules listed possible even though an invalid code may be given such that there will be 2 outputs, one conveying the deleted modules and the other conveying the modules not found. Intuitively, this should make sense? But not sure if converting this away from an error type will violate any requirements though.

```
        Set<Code> codesFound = new HashSet<>();
        Set<Code> codesNotFound = new HashSet<>();
        for (Code code : targetCodes) {
            Module moduleToDelete = new Module(code);
            if (!model.hasModule(moduleToDelete)) {
                codesNotFound.add(code);
                continue;
            }
            codesFound.add(code);
            model.deleteModule(moduleToDelete);
        }

        String deletedModules = String.format(MESSAGE_DELETE_MODULE_SUCCESS, codesFound);
        String notFoundModules = String.format(MESSAGE_DELETE_MODULE_NOT_FOUND, codesNotFound);

A minor bug I faced for the old tag command: When inputting "tag CS1101S" (assuming that CS1101S is in the module list), an exception is thrown and not handled, likely because no argument provided after. Could you check if it is handled here?

Hmm you make a good point, but I think typing out `view modules` again is kind of long and repetitive? As an alternative, maybe we can embed the sorting within the `list` command instead. In this case, `view modules` only needs to be called once to switch view, then the user can sort just by listing. I also think your second suggestion is better, which is just having the prefix to be sorted without the categorise. E.g. `list /g`, `list /m`

I'm not sure if we can separate it in v1.4, but if possible I think would be better since they belong to different categories (might be a small nitpick for some users, especially if one wants to find out their remaining SU quota), but if not it's alright too since they function similar to an S/U grade, just that we need to state in the UG.

The delete command is now split into `delete-index` and `delete-field`. `delete-index` only delete based on multiple indexes, while `delete-field` deletes internships based fields.

`delete-index` is able to delete multiple indexes. The format is `delete-index [index]...`. Example: `delete 1 3 4`.

`delete-field` is able to delete based on fields such as company name. The format is `delete-field [parameters]...`. The implementation is similar to the `find` command to be consistent. For each field F (company name, date, role, status), if the field F of an internship is in the list of arguments belonging to field F provided by the user, then that internship will be deleted. 

Example 1: `delete-field n/Google n/Amazon` deletes all internships with company name == google or company name == amazon. 

Example 2: `delete-field n/Google n/Amazon s/new` deletes all internships with (company name == google AND status == new) OR (company name == amazon AND status == new)

This is much less confusing for the user.

Note that both new commands works on the filtered list. ie. delete based on find or list. Therefore, if a user runs `find ...`, then delete-index and delete-field will delete based on what is shown to the user. This is consistent with the previous implementation. Moreover, it makes more sense for users to delete based on what they are able to see, not what they cannot see.

`find` has a different purpose from `delete`. `find` is supposed to work on an unfiltered list (it doesnt make sense to run `find` based on the result of a previous `find` command). However, `delete` best works on a filtered list, giving users a "delete what you see" experience. It will be odd if users can delete things that they cannot see.

As the undoManager saves the state of the addressBook after every deletePerson() method call, this implementation of multiple delete causes undo to restore one person at a time.

Instead, I suggest a new method, `deleteMultiplePersons(List&gt;Person>)` be added to the modelManager, that saves the addressBook state once, after all the deletions have completed.

The activity diagram here seems slightly confusing. If I understand correctly, the login screen is the screen that prompts you for a password, that only appears if the user enters ModCheck more than once. While ModCheck will prompt the user to create a password only if it is the first time the user enters ModCheck.

However, as the join node is before the "ModCheck requests Student to create a password" node here, the user will be requested to create a password every time he logs in (regardless of whether it is his first time logging in or not). I'm not sure if that is your intention in this activity diagram.

Thanks for implementing this command! LGTM! 

Here is a suggestion for future improvement: 

Current behaviour of ModCheck is that adding or editing a contact after a filter command reverts ModCheck back to showing all contact. However, deleting a contact after a filter command retains the filtered view until the filter is overwritten. 

The expected behaviour of add is debatable (whether to revert to all contact view or to remain in filtered view). However, I find it much more intuitive for edit to retain the filtered view. This is so an editing a person allows the person to still remain in the same position, from the user's point of view. 

This behaviour can be achieved by saving the predicate last used in the ModelManager. updateFilteredPersonList() can then be called with the saved predicate, instead of PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS. A new method, updatePredicate() can be used by the filter/view/find commands to change the predicate saved by ModelManager, and hence change the filtered view of ModCheck.

Tested reported bug and undo/redo works as intended.

Tested scenario: 
[Starting state] -`delete 1`-> [State 1] -`delete 1`-> [State 2] -`undo`-> [State 1] -`edit 1 t/`-> [State 3] -`Redo`-> _error: no command to redo_ -&gt; [State 3]

Any undone commands is not stored after further changes are made.

This behaviour is intended to prevent ambiguity on the expected state of ModCheck after redo, and is consistent with undo/redo in other software.

@Acerizm The screenshot in #113 is invalid. But going by the title of the bug report, I tested `delete john doe` when ModCheck contains 

- John Doe
- John Lim
- Jane Doe

and the delete by name function faced a similar issue as edit by name. I assume this is what the tester was referring to.

I've removed the reference to #113 in the PR.

Oh yes, it would. 

Using the FilteredList would only search what appears on the GUI, which means the subsequent find command cannot access the rest of the original list. Unlike mark/unmark/assign ... where we want users to only interact with the list shown. 

That's why I think that find command should search through the whole list instead of the filtered list.

All commands are zero-indexed based. The only thing that is one-indexed are the `Tasks` in `GUI`(I call this the `displayedIndex`).

Which means, every time GUI passes a `displayedIndex` to `logic`(e.g `:d 1`, which means delete the first displayed task, which is the zeroth task in the back-end `List`), and `logic` to `parser`, parser just needs to keep in mind that what the GUI passes is one-indexed and would need to do 
`int actualIndex = displayedIndex - 1;` to offset it.

In summary, all indexes are zero-based in the back-end, all indexes are one-index in the front-end.

Whenever front-end loads data from the back-end, what front-end gets is `actualIndex`, and would need to add one to get `displayedIndex`.

Whenever front-end tells back-end to execute a task using index, parser would receive is `displayedIndex` and would need to minus one to get `actualIndex`

This is intentional, we cannot use @FXML and initialize because it's a special marker to signalize an event of the initialize life cycle method of JavaFX that is triggered after loading and instantiating the component instance.

What I want is instead, setting up the child components before going into initializing, because there will be null pointer instead.

Because of the 2 reasons above, I deliberately named it setup() to avoid confusion with initialize() which caused some confusion and I will document it in the method next time.

I like how you are handling possible errors and interactions with the users.  Perhaps we could change the phrasing of "medication" to "medication prescription" to better describe the final action. Also, I think 'MESSAGE_SELECTED_DOCTOR_FAILURE' should end with "applicable for patients."

However, idts. If we include the application deadline, it may cause ambiguity as we will have the same job position from the same company to apply but the application can be done before different dates.  It is less likely to happen in our daily life. As a reminder, we have edit content and edit deadline for our todo task, which can handle these situations more gracefully.

hmm that is true, I thought there were some benefits to using an `AddPoints` inner class, like encapsulation, and it could also be easily extensible to do `pt/*1000`  because of the enum Modifier. This could signify some other form of modifier to be applied on points.

But I realise in the end I did not even parse the character before the Integer and merely made use of `Integer.valueOf`, so yeah I'll change it to what you suggest, and anyway I don't think we will be adding such functionalities on points, aside from addition and subtraction.

In the end, I still kept a validity check in `parseAddPoints`. I feel like if I allow any integer, some kind of obscure bugs could be found due to  integer overflow or underflow.

I was using it initially, but found out that Year's a static class and monad, where the of() method only accepts int, so I had to convert them somewhere in the code from String to int. But the main reason why I created the `YearOfBirth` class was coz I wanted to create the validity check, and I could just make all the attributes stay as a String in a class.

Yeah, I'm thinking of adding a generic for `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` class, so it'll become like `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate&gt;T>`, where T can represent person, client, project. This is cos right now `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` class implements `Predicate&gt;Person>`, and we could change implementation to `Predicate&gt;T>`. However, if we do change it to &gt;T>, we probably need to refactor like 40 methods to include the generic. What's yo opinion on this? @immanuelhume

This is so that we can test `updateFilteredClientList()` and `updateFilteredProjectList()` from `ModelManger`. Another way would be to just create another 2 classes to implement Predicate, but it would be less clean ig.

**Issue with "Tank has a list of fish"**

ModelManager currently manages all data additions, including the FishList and TankList. AddCommand for fish doesn't add a fish to tank's FishList

**Temporary Solution:**

1. On addition of fish, assign a tank in ModelManager
     1.1. Add fish to tank's FishList for viewing
2. Temporarily place fish in first available tank
     2.1. If no tank available, throw message to user

**Proposed Increments**

- [x] Make it impossible to add a fish without a tank index 
- [x] Take in an index to indicate which tank the fish is to be assigned to --> _fish add tank/1 ..._
- [x] Throw exception if given tank does not exist
- [x] Update AddCommand tests to have a tank
- [x] Upon adding the fish, add the fish to the tank's FishList.

**Questions:**

1. Should fish know which tank it is in?

Perhaps species is now not as prominent, but Dory's species is `Tetra`, whilst Marlin's species is `Parrot Fish`. Correctly, Dory is sorted after Marlin.

Hmm... I don't think the module will be counted for 8 MC. If I recall correctly, 1101S will map to both ULR and CSF, hence increasing the progression for both areas (I +4 to both tags here), but overall should be a +4MCs. Technically, the UE cap here should +4 too so that total MCs goes up to 160 with the double counting (I didn't increase the cap for UE here yet). Not sure if this applies to all other double mapping mods...

I was thinking about this. However, the public enum doesn't help since I need to map them over to the total credit for each requirement. Not sure if there is a way to properly enforce the tags here. Any ideas?

As for the use with UI, perhaps we could bring the enum out from `Tag.java` as a java file on its own. But I think keeping it under `model/tag` would make more sense since it is something pertaining to tag.

Wait does it? If I add CS1101S as 4 MC into ULR and another 4 into CSF, then by right I need to count 8 MC into GPA. But I think they only count 4 in total since they disallow double counting, which means 4 MC allocated to UE to ensure 160MCs is still done in total?

For the `list` into `show`, I think possible, but if the command modifies different parts of the app (eg. the stats part and the "terminal" part), not sure if same command would be a good idea.

For the clear part, I think the idea is that we will do in the next few iterations when we overhaul some parts of the commands. So for the iteration (v1.2), we try to modify our data (models, logic, whatever) from Address to Module first.

I considered it when i made the models, I think it would be good to provide shortcuts but at the same time might be hard for new user to remember specific tags. For example, FDN for CS Foundation I was thinking it as CSF, different users might remember differently. Either we can accept both tags (short and long form) or we have some sort of autocomplete/list to show the accepted short-form tags.

Idea for implementation (for now):
1. Create a DegreeProgressionData Model where the GPA, % progression per req and overall completion is kept.
2. Allow some way to refresh and get data through the Model interface.
3. Implement `show progress` command to refresh the data. Until the UI is implemented, I will probably return the output as a CommandResult.
4. Implement UI to be able to retrieve these data and render them accordingly in the GUI.

I have implemented a `isComplete()` into module with the data update (#62). Once it passes through, you can use it for the UI. I also have completedCredit and plannedCredit (completed + incomplete), perhaps in the degree progress you can include a bar to show the overall progress if possible? Pardon my poor drawing skills xd.

Honestly, I don't like the `list` syntax also. I think we can allow switching of the screen between `view modules` and `view progress`. However, I think we should keep `sort` separate from view.

Oh okay. In the end, I follow this [calculator](https://inetapps.nus.edu.sg/capcalc/cap_calculator.aspx) from FASS ah. Counts F, don't count U, and only have S and U. I think the S and U and CS and CU. Unless you think we really need to separate these then I will leave it, but I don't think the user will differ between these 2 when they modify their module entry to reflect SU-ing a mod.

The current implementation is that MODTrek has a cached copy of the module list, which is used to update the storage file whenever a command is executed. Any changes to the JSON during the app execution will not be reread.

Since 2 bug testers caught this "issue", I think it is best that we include this somewhere in the UG, to only allow JSON manipulation when the program is not running. I dislike enforcing having to load the module list from JSON file on every single command execution, with a large list it can make the program run slower. Alternatively, not sure if possible but we can also prevent user from editting the file directly? Personally I don't think this is possible. @AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-1/developers

New fix: Allow for negative duplication credit to remove ordering issue. Also added error handling for total duped credit &gt; 0 by telling the user that their list of modules is most likely invalid based on how they tagged them.

I also think we should probably have tightened the range available for the user's inputs to credit and tags, but then that's probably a feature flaw...

How does the original list look (in the view modules screen)? Honestly, I was thinking to sort by string for each category too anyway back in 1.3. I didn't realise this #142 "bug", would have rejected it since its more semantic issue than a bug lmao and we already stated the functionality in UG.

Yup this is feature change if we fix it. User can resize window if needed.
Planned enhancements should include character limit for naming of patients and wards, and a minimum width imposed on GUI elements to prevent such cut offs, and text wrapping.

I think `t/tags` needs to stay as it's can represent `TA`, `Professors`, `Classmate` etc.  ( it is also part of my feature ) and if you change `p/ phone numbers` to `/c contact numbers`, you need to update all of `/p phone numbers` references in User Guide and Developer Guide.

I think description field is needed which you suggested could be `d/`. The address ( not email address ) `a/` can be changed to `d/`. This allows @Gibson0918 view command to reflect somewhat below by his suggested ui below.

I think linking up with @Gibson0918 for your feature is good because his command requires your `d/` field and `m/` field. Can also assume the `t/` tag is there as well.

> Thanks for implementing this command! LGTM!
> 
> Here is a suggestion for future improvement:
> 
> Current behaviour of ModCheck is that adding or editing a contact after a filter command reverts ModCheck back to showing all contact. However, deleting a contact after a filter command retains the filtered view until the filter is overwritten.
> 
> The expected behaviour of add is debatable (whether to revert to all contact view or to remain in filtered view). However, I find it much more intuitive for edit to retain the filtered view. This is so an editing a person allows the person to still remain in the same position, from the user's point of view.
> 
> This behaviour can be achieved by saving the predicate last used in the ModelManager. updateFilteredPersonList() can then be called with the saved predicate, instead of PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS. A new method, updatePredicate() can be used by the filter/view/find commands to change the predicate saved by ModelManager, and hence change the filtered view of ModCheck.

Could I ask if the `ListCommandParser` is used here? 
Uncertained as I think that this is an [Unit Testing](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/website/schedule/week3/topics.html#w3-7-unit-testing) 
>**A proper unit test requires the unit to be tested in isolation** so that bugs in the dependencies cannot influence the test i.e. bugs outside of the unit should not affect the unit tests.

and this test file is to test only for correctness of `ListCommand` class method. For `ListCommandParser` class, is it better to create a separate test file named `ListCommandParserTest` and implement some test case based on the method in `ListCommandParser` class?

Yes, current implementation should accept flags with inputs as the example given by you. The reason I do that is because I believe user might input the wrong flag with could essentially remove wanted field value of address/email/profile/phone. By doing so, if an user wants remove field value of address/email/profile/phone, he/she could `remove 1 a/` or `remove 1 a/someaddress` but if the `someaddress` is not exists, it wont get removed.
PS: current implementation restrict the removal of name field

Yes, _both_ `remove 1 a/` and `remove 1 a/someaddress` would remove `someaddress` under the address field.

For my understanding, the removeCommandParser only helps to store the field indicate by the user, so removeCommandParser should do similar job to the original version of editCommandParser.

> While this implementation works to prevent overloading the GUI with too many tags, Do you intend to prevent the user from adding more than 10 tags? eg. by throwing an exception

I would think to not have an exception, as this may affects the user experience. For example, user type more 10 tags but program throws an exception which would need them to retype all the tags. I would consider to highlight this in the user guide, and let them know that only first 10 tags will be recorded

> I believe that user experience would be equally affected if you were to allow users to add more than 10 tags but not display them. A user who does not read the user guide would not understand the behavior. Requesting input from @chia-yh @cmang12 @nus-jeff so we can decide on a suitable implementation.

I update the changes to throwing exception, I realised the input text will be retained in the text field even when the program throws exception. @dillongoh Thanks for the suggestion.

> Previous images showed doctors and patients tags. These tags are added manually but when shown as an image would confuse the reader to think that it is added automatically

But shouldn't the tags be considered sample data? Just like how the loaded persons are sample data, the tags are also there to show readers that such tags exist.

Should NavigationContext be used directly in this case? NavigationContext was designed only for use with nav commands and navigation system. The command injection was designed to avoid coupling between command classes and navigation system while providing power users with the option to specify their own context without unnecessary syntax.

Commands such as AddCommand allow the user to explicitly specify context e.g `add L1 /mod CS2040S` alongside context-based usage e.g. `add L1` from CS2040S context. Perhaps consider parsing /mod and /lec arguments to determine context instead. This would allow user to specify their context directly for the find command i.e. `find Week 1 Week2 /mod CS2040S` to search for lectures in CS2040S that match the "Week 1" and "Week2" keywords.

hmmm but will it be more inconvenient for users because they would have to call the `list` command to clear any existing filters before calling a new filter? if going by your e.g., if they wanted to `find` people that are taking/have taken only CS2103T and forgot to call the `list` command beforehand, then the filtered list might show lesser people than the correct filtered list i.e. showing people having taken both CS2101 and CS2103T instead of people just having taken CS2103T. I think it would be better to have each find command apply the filter on the full original list everytime instead of nesting find commands, as originally intended, so users do not need to remember to call the `list` command if they just wanted to apply a different search and not a nested search. Users can already apply the nested search by typing `find c/cs2101 cs2103t`, and i think this is faster than typing `find c/cs2101` -&gt; `find c/cs2103t` (-> and if they wanted to apply a different filter they would have to follow it up by an additional `list` command to clear existing filters). also if we were to apply this nested finding method within just modules, then we would have to apply this to within other attributes and across different attributes, if not it wouldn't be consistent.

@ShawnYip-Au I see, regarding the appending of filters and using list to reset the filter, on hindsight it's a p good idea, as youtube and shopee also does this, by letting users check filter boxes and remember their choices, allowing them to continue checking boxes, and they also provide a reset filter button, so this replicates that feature. if we decide to go with this it would be better if it shows the current applied filters so that users can know what filters they have applied, as suggested by @harin0826 . Regarding consistency, can i clarify that this works not only within prefixes but across prefixes as well? So if the user types `find s/python` -&gt; `find s/java` -&gt; `find y/2`, it will find people that are y2 and have skills python and java?

Okay! LGTM, if can try to finish this "showing of current applied filters" by this week cos i think this is the last week to add features, not sure if they are strict about that, but if it's not possible and they do enforce this I guess we can just let the users know about this nested feature but they just would not be able to see the current applied filters, which is not a bug but just a feature that would be good to have.

Maybe instead of completely removing the reference to the ListPanels, can do it similar to the old AB3 diagram, but change `PersonListPanel` to `XXXListPanel`, then below the diagram can put a note that `XXX` can refer to studentlist, sessionlist etc. (similar to what AB3 did for `XYZCommandParser`)

I'm thinking it might be helpful to show a small object diagram also for a typical run (just 1 course with a few students). It would also be helpful for the reader to get a picture of how navigation is done. Since for now we only have class diagrams and sequence diagrams, and they encourage more different types of diagrams.

Interesting question. I used Model because the `LogicManager` where all the commands are processed doesn't view `Roster` directly, it has to act on the `Model` in order to modify `Roster`. In that sense, the states of our program from the `LogicManager`'s perspective are `Model`s. 

Though upon thinking about it now, it might be more intuitive to phrase it as `hasChangedRosterState`, since a `Command` only acts within the scope of a `Roster`, not the entire `Model`. Will make the change.

I actually have no idea why. But it's the way UniqueStudentList from AB3 was instantiated also, and since UniqueGroupList is just a mirror of it, I just kept it in case theres a special reason why they did it for AB3.

I actually found it a little dangerous as I encountered a nasty bug where my data was overwritten by this, upon first loading from storage, so ended up with empty data. Need to remember to call the resetData() when the object is instantiated.

just to clarify,
ive intentionally tried to be consistent to not italicisie the "first" in all examples of command formats. the only times i want to italicise them is in the sections that are before "Command Format" because the reader hasnt been introduced to what index means, so i draw extra emphasis there to show that the number for the command means something.

Note to whoever implements this:
Haven't tested this, but I believe duplicate studentIds can actually be added, if they're added to different groups. 
if you decide to implement `find` command to be able to be called from any page, e.g. `find` while in `course` page, be aware that it is possible for `find &gt;sid>` to give multiple results in our current implementation (as of 27/3)

Despite the exception name, error was thrown from task.replaceStudent()

In Group::addStudent, the student list replaced for each session, but is missing the same updating for tasks. Should be fixed by just copy pasting that `for loop` and change `session` to `tasks`

possibly can do away with dealing with prefixes at all, since there is only 1 field to edit, it is already implicitly implied that whatever argument will definitely be a remark.

I'm unable to reproduce it too. My closest suspicion would be it's caused by `undo`, could be some interaction with `home`. Not sure.

May want to investigate how the UI is refreshed after `undo`. I implemented it to just call either "handleSelectCommand()" or "handleBackCommand()", because those 2 methods are made to do a hard refresh on the UI, but they are designed specifically for their respective commands, without the consideration of `undo` being eventually implemented. I did this because I don't know the specifics of how UI works. If the problem is really this that the UI is not being refreshed properly, then the fix would be making a method specifically designed to refresh UI for `undo`

Could be related to #197, since the handling of closing those rightPanels are dependent on what is the current page. If the current page is wrong, the `undo` would not enter into the correct `switch-case` to handle UI correctly.

Not possible to fix this with limits, because resizing the window will also vary the truncation length. 
Will have to solve on UI side.

I feel like non-png files should be rejected, since the UI will only ever make use of .png photos. It seems strange that a user can upload anything without serving any purpose or seeing any errors. 

It might cause some confusion like here where the user might think the photo upload for a student was successful but actually did nothing

based on yx's comment

**we have some inconsistency for parameter name, e.g. NEW TASK NAME, PHONE_NUMBER (connected with underscore):** changed all white spaces in parameters to be underscore. check if covered everything

**I find the size of images is a bit off**: changed hardcoded resolutions to percentages. should be able to preserve proportions now

**Most of the hyperlinks are not working after changing the title name, might have to update them**: fixed for the instances that i manged to find

**capital letters are not consistent, e.g. enter key is sometimes ENTER / Enter**: all keyboard keys should be capitalised. ive chagned for all instances of `ENTER`. help to see if any other keys also

**Might need to explain what does words wrapping in code block mean**: i have defined inline-code format under the "Definitions" section, but i think to a layperson, inline-code and code-block are quite similar, so i assume they  would treat them the same. lmk wat u think

I'm not sure why we need to use the parsers to make commands here rather than just make the commands directly, and why we need to execute Commands rather than operate on the model directly.

Also the changes here form a very strong coupling between Model, the Parsers, and Person. Instead, we could put this function in the EditCommand class, since EditCommand has access to the model and other variables this function requires to reduce coupling and increase cohesion

Sorry, I wanted to test/write tests for the Commands so I had to implement all the logic and commands before I did that(as in see the modules in the AB3 UI). The Commands I wrote work I think (except Tag). I did list as well. I'm still trying to get some failed tests to pass. @jmestxr

Ok, I updated all the logic and tests(deleted some tests that don't work with the current command format eg. delete 2). We can merge this to the main branch if you guys are ok since it passes the CI/CD and it works with the AB3 UI. However, I still have not added extra functionality like varargs to TagCommand and Delete Command and delete all.

Not sure if it is mandatory for javadocs to contain @param if there are params specified in the function. In this case it is very clear what Tutorial p is, but under https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#comments it does not seem to say that @param can be excluded.. maybe we can check with our tutor on this.

It might be confusing/easily forgotten by the user that the default, argument-less behavior is to export only displayed `Persons`.

Perhaps allow an optional keyword to confirm this behavior, e.g. `export shown`? The default behavior with no arguments can still stay the same, i.e. goes ahead and exports only those displayed.
(but perhaps swapping default to exporting all would be more appropriate anw)

Hi, thanks for the info!

Some background is that `find` and `filter` run on `Predicates`, and so the display list will actually change who it shows automatically whenever people end up no longer satisfying (or newly satisfying) the `Predicate`.

This is the default behaviour of the base `AddressBook`, but there it's not very noticeable since the only time it makes a difference is when you `find` someone and then edit their name to something else.

However, here we implemented `filter` to search by all fields and later `mass` to perform a command on everyone visible - then we realised we had a problem whenever we would `filter` by a tag, `mass` `delete_tag` it early and then the whole selection would be gone.

It ended up being annoying to work around - we had to always `delete_tag` last or add more temporary tags, etc. So towards the end of development, `freeze` was added to freeze the `Predicates` & stop them from auto-updating to resolve this.

There's actually been a lot of reports like this lol so we'll be adding more detail to the UG to explain
(btw, when you enter a new `filter` in step 3 the `freeze` is immediately cancelled; that's gonna be explained as well)

Just updated the use cases and added 1 more NFR as well @harin0826

Maybe we can leave this issue open because along the way we will need to keep updating the developer guide. Alternatively, we could close this once someone has approved and merged my commits, followed by reopening a new one in the future when changes need to be made. What do you think?

Include in the UG that the command summary should be for long time users who happen to forget the features available, its not intended for first time users. First time users should follow our UG and read through the tutorial because we did state in the introduction of our UG to **read everything**.

This test is for `containsWordIgnoreCase` which specifies that the query word must be an exact match of the sentence word. Being part of the sentence word would result in the method returning `false`.
Perhaps you are thinking about the `containsKeywordIgnoreCase` test method? In which case yes it will return true.

@salty-flower.

Since we are adding multiple additional fields, modifying constructors in every PR can be a bit tricky because I add a constructor for let's say birthday and you add one for telegram, then we need to add one for both of them (which is a problem as we all are working on different features).

I would suggest adding a method such as `person.setTelegram(tele)` so that we add less breaking changes and it is much easier to handle such features.

Yes, your point is absolutely valid. How about reducing the use of raw `Person(...)` constructor and use `PersonBuilder` instead for most of our code? It supports chaining as well which seems quite convenient.

I checked again and realized `Person` is currently immutable and `PersonBuilder` is used only in test code.
Not sure if appropriate to really do that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

While it's possible to keep `Person` constructor untouched, I feel it's necessary to modify the `JsonAdaptedPerson` constructor to allow JSON serialization. Otherwise it seems that we have to implement `@JsonValue` and custom de-serialization functions, which can be messy too 🫠.

Thanks for the hard work, but it seems that `CCAs` and `CCA Positions` are decoupled and treated independently. For example, if I am a `leading wizard` of `Computer Muffin Cooks` and a `fellow worker` of `Mental Supporters for NUS Cats`, how would this design represent this two relationships?

Regarding the fate of `edit`, I agree that we can retire its functionalities on `tag`s. It might be confusing for users to find their `tag`s wiped out after hitting `edit INDEX t/`.

About the `+65` country code, I am not sure how shall we deal with it. Maybe instead of storing it into `value`, it's better to only do so when generating WhatsApp link, since our target audience are NUS students, most of whom use SG phone number everyday.

Yes, I did not notice the message representation and will add URL encoding later.

Good idea to remove Chatable. I was keeping it because I haven't decided whether to mimic this on Telegram. Thanks for the insight!

Maybe should we have the prefix as /location to be consistent with the /pilot prefix? Or the other way around works too.
Overall, I think we should streamline our prefixes across all commands ie. either all use acronyms or full words - I can do this later too.

I would guess we can create more exceptions that deal with these corner cases? We could also add a step during the linking process whereby we check the location of the object to be linked, and the location of the flight we want to link it to - if they're in different locations, we could indicate that message.

I could only figure out how to do this for commands in this form:
`commandType /prefix1 xxx /prefix2 xxx`

when /prefix1 is typed more than once. However, it doesn't detect an error when /prefix2 is typed more than once. Similarily, for commands which only take one prefix, I also wasn't able to have the parser detect the issue...

It's now fixed! I think running tp[build] and tp[checkStyleMain] doesn't check the style in UG, DG, and now our PPPs since they fall under repo-wide checks - so you guys might have to use do [this](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/markdown.html#reformat) to check for style in your PPP etc.

I don't really see an issue with using "Similar to use case ___ except..." as long as we're sure that it doesn't hide any details specific to that feature.

Theoretically it is impossible to add a duplicate plate number unless you extract the the customer out from the filtered list or you abuse `resetData() || overrideData()`.

```

However, if this sequence is used instead:

```
find nobody
clear
undo
```
Bug is replicated as `find nobody` returns an *empty person list* . Hence, `undo` will revert `clear` and return to the state found in `find nobody` which includes the *empty person list*. 

Unsure if this behavior is considered a bug as `undo` functions as expected.

I think they labelled it previously as d for DeleteCommand so they used d. So if he renamed EditCommand to e probably should use e. But about this, do we need to use labels? I'm not sure how they originally implemented the delete command, but if it's the same as how it is in InternBuddy, DeleteCommandParser simply returns a new instance of DeleteCommand without assigning it to any variable. So was the label of d in the original DeleteCommand sequence diagram solely for labelling purposes only? And if so do we continue labelling in our sequence diagrams?

How the parser works is it will first run getAllValues which returns a List&gt;String> where every element is a string containing all the words in every name field. I then loop through the string and split every string by the whitespaces, essentially like a flatMap. The previous implementation of find command found every internship entry that had any matching name keyword, so I stuck to their implementation which would mean that find n/google facebook and find n/google n/facebook would mean the same thing.

Tested it locally and works fine! We just need to remember to have to add another custom tip for the potential new status "Declined" should we choose to add it. 
I think the it wouldn't be necessary to reset the right panel the starting state since the starting state is the welcome message. One welcome message at the start should be enough.
Just an idea, if the right panel is looking a little empty, maybe we could just fill it up with like a custom picture for each status?
Other than that, LGTM!

Just a question, I noticed that when the c/COMMENT field in the add command is not added, the comment will be NA by default, so say I already have a comment and I want to delete it, to do so would just be using the edit command to set the comment to NA?

I identify this as a bug instead of feature flaw (as stated in Week 11 - project - Start fixing PED bugs - Q1) because:
- The behavior of filter display box in the reported case is "incorrect" instead of "can be better" since the user may not be able to see the applying features as they suppose to be
- There are really no way for user to walk around in such case that the history command records too many executed commands to see what's in the filter display box (e.g resizing the application window doesn't guarantee to help them see)

The changes fix the problem where there are characters/mob with the same name as the item to be added, but does not fix the problem where there is no entity with the name. getEntityFromName will return null and attempting to add null to the list will result in a NullPointerException. A possible fix is to check whether the entity is null and throw a ParseException instead.
On a side note, if method is to get an item from the list, getItemFromName may be a more suitable method name.

It is more reasonable to believe that users will remember the name of the entity they are searching for rather than the arbitrary index within Reroll. While clearly it is easier to type delete 1 than delete "name", one must consider the time taken to search up the index. Anyways, a possible alternative is to also support a delete by index function.

Sorry, I just tried the actions again and apparently they dont work once they have been removed. These onAction are highlighted in red on Intellij because the code doesn't know if the overall fxml file has a corresponding Ui class. Normally this would be the issue, but the default code given by the tutors actually handles this in the abstract class UiPart, so its alright to have the red highlighted onActions in the code. I've added them back in, which enables the user to clock exit on the File tab on top, and also pop-ups the link to the guides when help is pressed

Review is currently a bit buggy at the moment. Right now updateItem() in ReviewStatsPanel.java is updating multiple instances of the same element in the ReviewStatPanel, leading to unintended results.

From debugging, issue does not seem to be from LogicManager.java, ModelManager.java or Review.java as the getReviewStatsList method is only called once.

Issue could be in MainWindow.java or somewhere else in UI handling.

> `updateItem()` in ReviewStatPanel will be called everytime the ObservableList `reviewStatsList` is modified. Current when we call the method `updateReviewStatsList` in Review, the Observable List is modified twice (clear, then add). Is this potentially the source of your issue?

I doubt this is the case... from my testing, modifying the ObservableList just once or multiple times results in the same issue.

I have thought about this and prefer to keep value as String for consistency with attributes of other classes. Change it to BigDecimal will result modifications in parsers.

For summing we can create BigDecimal from the String value, then convert back to String and create new editedTxn object.

The current definition of duplicate transaction is: 
1. Same description
2. Same Owner
3. Same value
4. (Status not included)

So currently we allow a transaction to have same description, same owner, same status but different value, which is the case reported by this tester.

Action: will update a more detailed definition of duplicate transactions in UG.

Hi this issue only seems to appear on Mac, and unfortunately my team does not have access to a MacBook for testing. Hence, now that I've fixed the code, may I trouble you to help test the `import` and `export` commands? I only need to know if it crashes or not. Thank you!

I think this is a problem with the data
It is specified in the user guide that every student will have the a submission for every existing assignment

Nevertheless I will still put an error message if that is the case:

This will not start the GUI as the error happens within the initialization stage

Maybe we can put some specifications in the user guide on how to format the csv(?)

The suggestion is correct, here EditMeetingDescriptor is a helper class and it should be a private class. But Parser needs to access EditMeetingParser needs to pass it values to fill up so it has to be public. 

We could pass to EditMeetingCommand and have EditMeetingCommand pass to EditMeetingDescriptor but then EditMeetingCommand would then call back EditMeetingDescriptor for its values which doesn't make sense. Command might as well done it itself

Yes I can do this without creating a class.  I am abstracting out the get and setters, so the responsibilities of getting and setting is in another class. SRP

Putting it at the end of EditMeetingsCommand will make the class like ridiculously long and give it too much responsibility.

As 2 classes like it is now. if a description break, you know its in the description class. 
If creating the EditCommand/Executing breaks we know its the main class that broke.

 If we combine it both, then stepping through code will be harder because it will just be a long nest of EditMeetingsCommand doing a mix of getting and setting creating and comparing values (Duo responsibilities)
 
 we can say that EditMeetingCommand is responsible for its own description, but we see the length of the descriptor class and it is clear that the description is a big responsibility (getting,setting, interacting with parser and error checking) it is better to separate it

Unfortunately need to resolve checkstyle issues
Also, the Model interface is about to change quite drastically wrt to switching from person objects to wards/patients/staff etc so a lot of things are about to break everywhere, since the model section is going through changes
This pr will probably be obsolete by the time I finish changing Model

> What changes are you making with model exactly? We should minimise the changes so that we don't need to do so much work.

Changes to the API to support Patient and Staff objects with the relevant CRUD features for them, and containing them in Ward objects. Patientist will now hold a WardList object that contains 1..* Ward objects, and API supporting CRUD for this Wards feature will be included too.

Will open PR soon to show diffs in the API, but breaking changes are unavoidable if we are to implement wards/patients/staff classes

The implementation of saving to storage (JsonAdaptedWard) etc is up to whoever is doing the storage component. Model just defines the structure of data and an API to interact with the data, how it is parsed to be written to storage is abstracted away from Model.

Looks good, btw just fyi you can open the gradle interface on the right of your screen and under verification you'll find a task called check, which automatically runs checkstyle job for you locally so you can get checkstyle out of the way before pushing and not have to rely on CI to do checkstyle for you

By the way you might want to watch out with the naming conventions of your commits, as quoting the module git standards
“Commit message headers should read as if there were a hidden ‘When merged, this commit will’ before it”
So example would be “Fix personList disappearing …” instead of “Fixed personList …”

@jinnieshin Just curious, any updates on this end? List command for patients in a particular ward appears done (see #79) and will likely be merged soon. 1.2 can be closed after this PR closes.

We need to take screenshots of the product and upload it in the google document and then update Danny by tonight, so as and when you're done, do put in some dummy data as you're doing user testing and take the screenshots as you test functionalities. (Test new stuff such as listing patients, finding patient, listing staff, viewing specific patient)

Just paste those screenshots at the bottom of the google doc and ping Danny in the group 1 MS teams private channel, thanks!

this is featureflaw, we cannot fix this anymore. Anyway, if this shows up in the actual PE, I believe we can reject this bug. Adding/removing wards is not something that happens very often, and most users will not have to engage this feature. There is little room for error if correctness is ensured when the ward is first built and added.

### Commit Feature

1. A change is going to be made upon current AddressBook, eg. setAddressBook. deletePerson, addPerson. Call it function x
2. **ModelManager#function x** is invoked. After change was made, **VersionedAddressBook#commit** will be called.
3. Record down current version as the latest AddressBook in history.

### Undo Feature

1. User type in "undo"
2. Calls **LogicManager#execute** 
3. Pass to **addressBookParser#parseCommand**, return a undoCommand back to **LogicManager#execute** 
4. Calls **UndoCommand#execute**. Check if we can undo by calling **model#canUndo**. If can, call **model#undo**
5. Calls **versionedAddressBook#undo** which returns reference to undo version of Addressbook.
6. Calls **Model#setAddressBook** (Overload function). Reset current AddressBook to clone of undo version of Addressbook.

Hmm @tyx021 I feel that we shouldn't remove the left bar as they act as page tabs to show clearly to the user what page they are on so that they can use the relevant commands, and the top bar (navigation bar) was to show exactly which course/group/session/task they are on. But @swxk19 yes as @tyx021 mentioned the current selected group is already shown in the navigation bar but maybe I can adjust the font to make it more noticeable? 🤔

Functionality is now as follows:
* All text-based searches with `find` will find by partial match, eg.
_Given entry of Name: Alice, Phone: 91234567, Address: Pasir ris, the following commands all outputs this entry:_
```
find n/ ali
find p/ 912
find a/ sir
```
**Take note due to using `tokenize` in implementation, a space between `Prefix` and `Keyword` is needed.**
* Find by tags will require the full match of the `tagName` 
* Made a new package under `parser` called `Predicates`
* **CLISyntax now contains a method called `isPrefix` which just checks if a specified `Prefix` is not an imposter**

With the most recent change, i have made it such that:
`delete 1 1` gives a new error message
`delete` shows the command usage
`delete 1a` shows invalid index
This is done so that delete command is consistent with all other commands.

Please be careful and help to confirm this, i have no idea if this is allowed in 1.4

Edit: can fix, good to go

Changed theme back to minima. The accompany `css` files in `_sass` and `assets` directory are all part of the `minima` theme Jekyll package. If we want to change theme we will have to change these files to the ones that come with the new theme. 

Lets stick to the default `minima` theme for now.

Changed Start and End constructor to take in LocalDateTime instead of String. EventParserUtil now Validates the input string using DateTimeUtil before parsing it to LocalDateTime. Changed TimeParser to DateTime, strictly an abstract data class. Start and End still inherits from DateTime and most of TimeParser's original methods are still in DateTime.

I was actually thinking the reverse since we have a GUI. A user might have forgotten/want to add something from their previous search after finding for contacts. Therefore, instead of retyping everything, they can just append to the current search. So, the mindset for finding will be to find from the list presented in the GUI as oppose to finding from the full list which is hidden in the background.

As for consistency—I should have been more clear—this works for all prefix in any combination that are supported by find not just module. i.e. name, year(although makes no logical sense to do it), course, skill, module and does not take away any of the previous functionality.

@linustws Yep, for our default set of contacts dong all those will only output Bernice Yu who fit all predicate. As for " shows the current applied filters as suggested by @harin0826" I can add it later in the week, appending it to the current output.

> Is this really necessary?

I think we could make the argument that since it is a phone number attribute and the maximum phone number lenght is 15 digits world-wide, it makes sense for an extremely long phone number to be a functionality bug. Will check if tutor/ prof Damith on forum

After reviewing the forum I think it is safe to say that this is a feature flaw, rather than a bug. 

# Suggested actions:
## 1. Include the following in Future features
- Implement feature constraint such that phone number can only have up to 15 digits, as that is the longest possible mobile phone number.
## 2. Clarify phone number properties in UG
- Mention that phone numbers can be be infinitely long, which will be fixed in the future, and current users can use it as they see fit.

I think the problem is with `this.viewTaskList = FXCollections.observableList(taskList.getInternalList());` in LogicManager. 
According to FXCollection documentation, `mutation operations made directly to the underlying list are not reported to observers`
The list can be updated by e.g. `viewTaskList.add(task);`. However, it means that LogicTaskList might have to store the observableList, which we are avoiding. 

I think this is the only way to update the list, but i am not very sure

I think 
1. its better to unify todo and deadline
2. for priority and status, we should not allow users to add or delete, can only edit

1. throw error for invalid integer for priority/status
2. better error messages (label already exist, index out of bound, missing input, invalid input)
3. detail task panel auto update (remove "l")

This is not a bug, but rather an intended behaviour. The detailed information section and the command box functionality are designed to be completely separate and are not intended to interact with each other. As such, we have made a conscious decision not to introduce any interaction between the two features, as this could potentially result in significant changes to the codebase and increase the risk of introducing bugs.

ok sure! tbh i think when we execute the command, the command will have access to the task list so that it will compare the list with the index, and throw an error if there is index out of bounds. However, edit seems to catch and throw the correct error but included the more general error message. For the 0 index, it is because when the parser throws the error, the catcher throw a new exception but with message about the standard usage of command. Therefore, I feel that the problem is just how we chose the error message.

Change in PersonListCard.fxml and PersonCard profile to add a label 'time' that shows Person's scheduled time.
The constructor of JsonAdaptedPerson Class, however, is not modified accordingly in correct way, waiting for future improvements.
Add a command ListTime to sort Persons with scheduled time in order. In UI the input should be 'listTime' but the feature is not implemented correctly, the filteredPersons is of the class FilteredList, which can not be sorted. Thus, the updateScheduledTime method in class ModelManager fails. Future modifications are needed to show the filtered and sorted list in the MainWindow.

Resolved the bug of sorting the list !!!!
However, commented on three test cases in EditCommand and DeleteCommand, 
because I have modified the filteredPersons in ModelManager.
Initially, data in the address book is directly passed into the filteredPersons. Now it's coped into ObservableList persons and then passed to filteredPersons, so the persons can be reassigned with the list we have sorted, which will be shown in UI. 
The updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate&gt;Person> predicate) method is also modified so that the ObservableList persons can grab data from the address book again and we get our complete list in UI.
